1	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
2	“这是再自私不过的理由，”火箭生气地说，	2
3	“尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	4
4	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
5	我可以问一声，你生来就这副样子，还是一场事故造成的？”	5
6	随后黑人们抓住奴隶中最小的一个，取掉了他的手铐，往他的鼻孔儿和耳朵眼儿灌满蜡油，在他腰间系了一块石头。	5
7	朝臣这下全乐了，有人索性冲他大声喊：“陛下，人民在等待自己的国王，你却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒火顿生，说：“他为我们国家带来耻辱,不配做我们的一国之君。”	2
8	Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents, said the Waterrat, "I am not a family man. 	5
9	Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'	4
10	我讨厌那些夸夸其谈、口口声声离不开自己的人，你就这个德性,人家都还想谈谈自己呢，我就是这样。	5
11	“果真如此吗？”他问道，	6
12	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	3
13	他嗖地直冲云霄，人们都以为他一去不复返了呢。	8
14	God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.	4
15	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
16	“如果我不穿上国王服装，他们就不会知道我是国王吗？”	6
17	Ah! what a trivial view of life! said the Rocket; "but it is only what I expected.	5
18	“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你一定要飞往埃及去。”	1
19	上帝造岀了蚊蜥蜴和疆鼠，它们各有自己的地盘。	8
20	“谁竟敢伤害你？”巨人大声责问道，“快告诉我，看我拿上我的大剑，去把他砍了。”	2
21	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	1
22	“世上还真有不折不扣的情种，”夜莺说，	6
23	星孩看看盾里的那个人，瞧瞧吧！他的脸完全像过去一样，他的英俊又回到了他身上，他还在他的眼睛里看到了他过去不曾见过的东西。	6
24	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'	2
25	“我们不知道，”孩子们回答说，“他离去了吧。”	8
26	There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.	6
27	And the Star–Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before.	6
28	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
29	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。”	0
30	这根本就是城郊地带。	8
31	One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?"	7
32	One day the Giant came back. 	8
33	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
34	In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!"	6
35	Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.	8
36	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
37	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
38	别伤害它。	4
39	阿富汗人把那头黑公牛杀死了,正往战场开赴。	5
40	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	4
41	到我的城市上空去飞一趟，小燕子，回来告诉我你在下面看见了什么。”	7
42	What a success I am!"	0
43	I am made for public life, said the Rocket, "and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.	7
44	The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp. 	5
45	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
46	我很清楚我的样子有多么可憎可恶！”	5
47	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
48	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
49	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
50	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	1
51	They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. 	5
52	按宫廷御医说，那个生下他的白人姑娘是死于悲伤或瘟疫；而另有人则说是用一杯配制好的意大利烈性毒酒让她服下，不到一小时就活活弄死了她;那个可靠的信差，把这孩子放在鞍子前面就跑了，等他跳下疲劳的马、敲开牧羊人小屋的柴门时，公主的尸体正在往挖开的墓穴里放。	3
53	多么可怕的灾难！	3
54	“为一朵红玫瑰？”他们同声惊讶道，“真是咄咄怪事啊！”小蜥蜴是一个喜欢拿别人开心的人，忍不住哈哈笑出声来。	6
55	他们对他说：“是一个乞丐，一个要饭的孩子，我们把他赶走了。”	5
56	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."	0
57	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	1
58	He was a very selfish Giant.	5
59	It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.	0
60	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？”	2
61	新娘和新郎将要一起跳玫瑰舞，国王已答应吹笛伴乐。	7
62	I am off to look for my daughters.	8
63	'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.'	7
64	“我看春天终于来了。”巨人说；他从床上跳下，往外张望。	7
65	再往远处,在一片果园里，一只夜莺在欢唱。	0
66	He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.	4
67	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
68	As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.	7
69	What a terrible misfortune! 	3
70	“他为什么哭呢？”一只小绿蜥蜴问道,他把尾巴高高翘在空中，从他身边走过。	6
71	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
72	Pray, what are you laughing at? inquired the Rocket.	6
73	我们今后怎么养活他呢？她生丈夫的气了。	2
74	星孩听了这话又一次对他大发慈悲，把那块红色的金子白送了他，说：“你比我更需要它。”	4
75	“因为他不再美丽，所以就不再有用了。”大学的美术教授说。	5
76	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
77	“我敢说，要是我早就认识他，我根本不会成为他的朋友。	7
78	这下我能写完我的剧本了。”他看上去相当幸福。	0
79	“我要去埃及！”燕子大声说，可是没有人在意，月亮升起来时，他又飞回快乐王子身边。	7
80	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket, and he began to cough.	8
81	“天哪！”鹅大声叫道，	6
82	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
83	It saves time, and prevents arguments."	8
84	Now I am going off! he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.	7
85	闲人莫入，违者法办	3
86	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.	2
87	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.'	3
88	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
89	Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.'	7
90	Somebody must listen, answered the Frog, "and I like to do all the talking myself.	8
91	第二天，魔术师来到他跟前，说:“今天你要是不把那块黄金给我带来，那我肯定要把你当奴隶使唤，抽你三百鞭子。”	3
92	So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.	8
93	那是花园最远的角落,一个小男孩儿正站在那里。	1
94	'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	3
95	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
96	Hans,' said the Miller, 'friendship never forgets.	4
97	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
98	The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.	8
99	She is like a white rose! they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.	0
100	“是这话，”他的同伴说，“有些人得到的太多，有的人得到的太少。	8
101	But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.	1
102	在城堡的大门前，王子正在迎接她。	7
103	Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, "but you are more beautiful than your picture"; and the little Princess blushed.	0
104	他重重地摔进了浪头里，他的伙伴赶快得得得跑走了。	1
105	But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.'	6
106	劝我母亲和我说一次话吧。”	7
107	可是这些事情与你有什么关系？	6
