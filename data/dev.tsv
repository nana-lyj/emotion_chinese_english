1	他们的羽毛让白霜冻得硬刷刷,但是他们一点儿也不在乎;他们滚动着他们的大黄眼睛，在森林里彼此遥相呼叫：“啯啯啯喵------啯啯!啯啯啯喵------啯啯！我们遇到了多么好的天气啊！”	0
2	实际上是王子的铅做的心脏破成两瓣儿了。	5
3	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
4	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
5	“给我唱最后一支歌儿吧，”他悄悄说，“你走后我会感到非常孤单的。”	7
6	'Oh! they will come to you,' said the Miller, 'but you must take more pains.	7
7	It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.	0
8	你快去那些需要你的地方，躲开我的仆人吧。	3
9	她在大庭广众前露面的时候,一口气旋转上十九次才熄灭，而且每旋转一次她就往空中抛去七颗粉色的星星。	0
10	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
11	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
12	他无论飞到哪里都听见麻雀叽叽喳喳在叫，互相交谈说：“好一位稀客呀！ ”他听了心下好不喜欢。	5
13	He was very much admired indeed.	4
14	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
15	我实际上没有露面，可是我一旦露面，那场面可就好看极了。	7
16	他马上脸色惨白，说：“为哪位国王？”	3
17	他一蹦一跳进去，把嘴里的大红宝石放在了那个女人的顶针旁边。	6
18	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	0
19	炎热的太阳火辣辣地烤着他们。	5
20	他们把爱写滥了，谁都不信他们的了，我早料到这一步了。	5
21	But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, 'Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.	5
22	And one evening he came to the gate of a strong–walled city that stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.	7
23	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
24	As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.	7
25	然而玫瑰树摇了摇头。	5
26	这世界的负重是任何一个人都承担不了的，这世界的悲哀也是任何一颗心都承受不了的啊。	1
27	Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art."	6
28	One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.	0
29	'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's youngest son.	6
30	But I am going to buy them all back again now.'	8
31	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
32	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
33	那声音十分迷人,，非凡的火箭大家都躺在床上不睡，听我们唱歌。	6
34	“看看人家快乐王子从 来不为小事哭闹。”	7
35	一天晚上，他来到一座城门前，该城位于河边，城墙非常坚固，尽管他累得不行，脚又很疼，他还是准备进城去。	7
36	他的朋友六个星期前都飞往埃及去了，但他耽搁下来，因他和最美丽的芦苇相爱了。	0
37	他当然是爆炸了。	3
38	据说，一位健壮的市长前来代表本城的全体市民发表一份华丽的演说，却发现他五体投地地跪在一幅刚刚从威尼斯运来的大画像前，好像在对某些新神顶礼膜拜。	3
39	可是玫瑰树还是揺头。	5
40	You will hear our glee-club this evening.	7
41	真的，我一贯认为，苦活儿累活儿只是那些什么活儿都干不了的人的最后去处。”	5
42	Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.	6
43	And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.	5
44	“可是人家并没有失去他们唯一的儿子,”焰火筒说，“他们根本就没遇上倒霉的事。”	0
45	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
46	“真是怪事啊！”在铸造车间干活儿的工人监工说，	6
47	It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow–trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s–throw away.	0
48	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air; "impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	6
49	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
50	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	5
51	一等他们把锚抛下，收好帆索，黑人们就到货舱里拿出一架长绳梯，上面拴着沉甸甸的铅块儿。	5
52	大家都引用那封信里的话，因为里面尽是人们不明白的词儿。	4
53	河马藏在香蒲下面，门农神由坐在一个大花岗岩宝座上。	8
54	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
55	And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.	4
56	它真美，我相信它有一个长的拉丁名字；”他弯下身去摘了它。	4
57	黑人们抓过他手里的珍珠，又把他推向海中。	3
58	And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, 'Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?'	4
59	And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.	6
60	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
61	And the Hare answered him, and said: 'Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?'	7
62	I hate people who cry over spilt milk.	5
63	他这样穿戴好，走出他的宫寝，进了大厅，满朝文武大臣都正在那里静候他。	7
64	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
65	Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.	3
66	他飞入阴暗的小巷里看见那些饥饿的小孩带着苍白的瘦脸没精打彩地望着污秽的街道。	5
67	可是你可以到我兄弟那里去，他生长在那个大学生的窗子底下，也许他会给你想要的东西。”	7
68	There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.	7
69	Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.	0
70	You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose, cried the Student.	7
71	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
72	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
73	比如说,假如今天夜里我有个三长两短，这对谁来说都是一大不幸！	1
74	再一次跟你告别,我老远就看见我的女儿们了。”小青蛙游着水离去了。	7
75	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
76	“我根本不是你的儿子，	2
77	“我笑是因为我高兴呀。”爆竹回答说。	0
78	“他也是傻子一个,竟不呆在这里！”火箭说，	5
79	A delightful voice, certainly, continued the Frog; "I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.	7
80	You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	0
81	In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.	5
82	他走过时蛭蛇冲他嘶嘶直叫，鲜亮的鹦鹉叽叽喳喳在枝头飞来飞去。	0
83	过了一会儿，潜水员从海水里浮上来,喘着粗气，右手拿着一颗珍珠，往绳梯上爬。	5
84	我们踩榨葡萄，别人喝葡萄酒。	5
85	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
86	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
87	And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.	8
88	“噫，那是他的损失，对我没有什么，”火箭回答说，	4
89	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
90	That is not conversation.	8
91	你应该多想想别人。	8
92	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!”	5
93	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
94	And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, 'In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold.	7
95	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	6
96	商人虐待我们，我们必须对他们言听计从。	3
97	啧，我看跟宫廷大臣的侄儿根本没法儿相比，你的鞋上可有银襻子？”她从椅子上站起身，走进了住宅。	5
98	“如果你想给别人快乐，”焰火筒大声说，	4
99	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	1
100	The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.	4
101	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
102	物革旦人的山区里正在打仗，双方的国王都在召唤你呢。	7
103	星孩于是走向树林，花了整整一天时间搜寻那块黄金，但是怎么找也找不到。	1
104	However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.	7
105	他脸上盖着一块灰色的麻布头巾，从小网眼儿里他的眼睛闪射出灼人的光芒。	3
106	于是燕子啄下王子的一只眼睛，衔着飞向那个学生的阁楼去了。	1
107	不公平瓜分了这世界，除了忧愁分得公平，什么东西都分得不公平。”	2
108	I like the Miller immensely.	8
109	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
110	“的确寒珍！”市议员们大声说,他们总是跟着市长的调子唱,他们走过去端详那塑像。	4
111	“一定是那个代表来了。”火箭说,努力做出很有尊严的样子。	7
112	“爱情是一样多么稀松的玩意儿,大学生离去时心下说，“比起逻辑来一半都不如，最终什么都证实不了，只不过说明一件不会发生的事情，逼着人相信事情没有真实可言。	1
113	My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.	0
114	政府为什么连管也不管呢？”	2
115	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
116	And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother.	7
117	What a very stupid thing to do'!	8
118	'Upon my word,' said the Miller, 'you are very lazy.	2
119	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'	2
120	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
121	因为花园里没有孩子们，鸟儿不愿意在里面唱歌，桃树也忘记开花了。	1
122	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
123	“有人在埃及等我呢，”燕子回答说，	7
124	务必把那块白金带来,要不你过不了这关，别忘了你是我的奴隶,我可是用一碗甜酒的价钱把你买来的。”	3
125	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
126	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	3
127	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	7
128	It is just like being in church.'	4
129	有些人以为只要你没完没了念叨同一件事情，它终会如你所说，转轮焰火就是这种人。	2
130	一层薄薄的红晕岀现在玫瑰的叶子里，宛如新郎初吻新娘的柔唇时脸上露出的潮红。	0
131	“得得得，是我说到焰火技术的，”火箭说，口气十分严厉，信号焰火觉得当头挨了一棒，立即对身边的小爆筒开始吹胡子瞪眼睛，显示他不管怎样都是有身份的人物。	8
132	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
133	Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.	6
134	他被黄亚麻布裹得紧紧的，用各种香料涂过以防止腐烂。	8
135	“你的情况也许是这样，”他回答说，“而且我对此也深信不疑，可是我的情况就大不一样了。	4
136	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说，	2
137	'Nay,' answered the Hare, 'but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with thee,' and it ran away swiftly, and the Star–Child went towards the city.	4
138	他的双唇像蜜一样甜，他的呼吸像乳香四溢。	0
139	她心里只有音乐，谁都知道艺术是自私的。	5
140	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	4
141	我能嗖地飞上天空，像金色阵雨一样落下来，你听了这话肯定会感到惊讶的。	7
142	Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.	6
143	但是冬天把我的叶脉冻坏了，霜冻摧毁了我的花蕾，暴风雨折断了我的树枝，今年我没法开玫瑰花了。	1
144	他们飞走后，他感到很孤单，渐渐对他的恋人儿厌倦了。	5
145	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	2
146	I like hearing myself talk.	0
147	快快滚到一边。	2
148	他们把仙人掌连根拔起,踩踏上面的红色花朵。	5
149	I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.	6
150	They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.	0
151	然而我有想象力，我从来就没有按事物的本来面貌去想,我总认为它们有截然不同的一面。	8
152	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
153	But the little ducks paid no attention to her.	7
154	他倚靠在一张堆满纸的桌子旁,他身边的一只杯子里插着一束枯萎的紫罗兰。	8
155	可怜的孩子们这下没有地方可玩儿了。	1
156	So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.	0
157	But the Tree shook its head.	1
158	So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.'	7
159	但是他对他们说：“我不配啊，因为我不认我的亲生母亲，在我找到她，求得她的原谅之前，我是不会心安的。	1
160	“那颗破裂的铅心在炉里竟然没化掉。	6
161	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	1
162	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
163	于是他修建了一堵髙墙，把花园围起来，还挂上一块牌子：	8
164	哦，再见,听我说没错，能跟你交谈我很高兴。	4
165	The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.	0
166	That is the important thing.	4
167	年轻的国王从高高的祭坛走下来，穿过人群，向宫中走去。	7
168	“我是多么想见见他啊！”他经常说。	7
169	然而他记起了他做的几个梦,就和他的朝臣说：“把这些东西拿走，我不会用它们的。”	4
170	他低下头祈祷，穿着硬教袍的祭司们悄悄退下了祭坛。	4
171	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭说着就咳嗽起来了。	6
172	那是一个冬天，入夜后天冷得更厉害了。	3
173	'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.	7
174	“在远处一条小街上，有一所穷人住的房子。	8
175	But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.	5
176	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
177	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
178	How lucky you mentioned it!	6
179	It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.	0
