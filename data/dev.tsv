868	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
869	All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.	8
870	And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.	6
871	But the Tree shook its head.	1
872	What a very stupid thing to do'!	8
873	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
874	There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.	7
875	I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.	6
876	“的确寒珍！”市议员们大声说,他们总是跟着市长的调子唱,他们走过去端详那塑像。	4
877	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
878	“一定是那个代表来了。”火箭说,努力做出很有尊严的样子。	7
879	她心里只有音乐，谁都知道艺术是自私的。	5
880	I like the Miller immensely.	8
881	But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.	5
882	“噫，那是他的损失，对我没有什么，”火箭回答说，	4
883	But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, 'Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.	5
884	他一蹦一跳进去，把嘴里的大红宝石放在了那个女人的顶针旁边。	6
885	“那颗破裂的铅心在炉里竟然没化掉。	6
886	“得得得，是我说到焰火技术的，”火箭说，口气十分严厉，信号焰火觉得当头挨了一棒，立即对身边的小爆筒开始吹胡子瞪眼睛，显示他不管怎样都是有身份的人物。	8
887	“爱情是一样多么稀松的玩意儿,大学生离去时心下说，“比起逻辑来一半都不如，最终什么都证实不了，只不过说明一件不会发生的事情，逼着人相信事情没有真实可言。	1
888	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	5
889	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
890	One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.	0
891	那声音十分迷人,，非凡的火箭大家都躺在床上不睡，听我们唱歌。	6
892	他倚靠在一张堆满纸的桌子旁,他身边的一只杯子里插着一束枯萎的紫罗兰。	8
893	“可是人家并没有失去他们唯一的儿子,”焰火筒说，“他们根本就没遇上倒霉的事。”	0
894	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
895	他们把爱写滥了，谁都不信他们的了，我早料到这一步了。	5
896	我能嗖地飞上天空，像金色阵雨一样落下来，你听了这话肯定会感到惊讶的。	7
897	And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, 'In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold.	7
898	比如说,假如今天夜里我有个三长两短，这对谁来说都是一大不幸！	1
899	然而我有想象力，我从来就没有按事物的本来面貌去想,我总认为它们有截然不同的一面。	8
900	他们飞走后，他感到很孤单，渐渐对他的恋人儿厌倦了。	5
901	“我看岀来了，是新来的！”青蛙说，	0
902	And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.	4
903	However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.	7
904	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
905	So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.	0
906	然而玫瑰树摇了摇头。	5
907	“如果你想给别人快乐，”焰火筒大声说，	4
908	河马藏在香蒲下面，门农神由坐在一个大花岗岩宝座上。	8
909	But I am going to buy them all back again now.'	8
910	But the little ducks paid no attention to her.	7
911	In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.	5
912	实际上是王子的铅做的心脏破成两瓣儿了。	5
913	And the Hare answered him, and said: 'Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?'	7
914	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
915	The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.	4
916	“我笑是因为我高兴呀。”爆竹回答说。	0
917	You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	0
918	“有人在埃及等我呢，”燕子回答说，	7
919	'Oh! they will come to you,' said the Miller, 'but you must take more pains.	7
920	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	7
921	“你的情况也许是这样，”他回答说，“而且我对此也深信不疑，可是我的情况就大不一样了。	4
922	“他也是傻子一个,竟不呆在这里！”火箭说，	5
923	'Nay,' answered the Hare, 'but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with thee,' and it ran away swiftly, and the Star–Child went towards the city.	4
924	一层薄薄的红晕岀现在玫瑰的叶子里，宛如新郎初吻新娘的柔唇时脸上露出的潮红。	0
925	他的双唇像蜜一样甜，他的呼吸像乳香四溢。	0
926	And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother.	7
927	有些人以为只要你没完没了念叨同一件事情，它终会如你所说，转轮焰火就是这种人。	2
928	真的，我一贯认为，苦活儿累活儿只是那些什么活儿都干不了的人的最后去处。”	5
929	你应该多想想别人。	8
930	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'	2
931	So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.'	7
932	啧，我看跟宫廷大臣的侄儿根本没法儿相比，你的鞋上可有银襻子？”她从椅子上站起身，走进了住宅。	5
933	And one evening he came to the gate of a strong–walled city that stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.	7
934	Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.	3
935	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
936	“这里好冷啊，”他说，“不过我会跟你呆上一个夜晚，给你当送信的人。”	0
937	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	1
938	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
939	再一次跟你告别,我老远就看见我的女儿们了。”小青蛙游着水离去了。	7
940	但是冬天把我的叶脉冻坏了，霜冻摧毁了我的花蕾，暴风雨折断了我的树枝，今年我没法开玫瑰花了。	1
941	'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's youngest son.	6
942	'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.	7
943	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	6
944	'Upon my word,' said the Miller, 'you are very lazy.	2
945	“给我唱最后一支歌儿吧，”他悄悄说，“你走后我会感到非常孤单的。”	7
946	Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.	6
947	And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.	5
948	They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.	0
949	可是你可以到我兄弟那里去，他生长在那个大学生的窗子底下，也许他会给你想要的东西。”	7
950	他无论飞到哪里都听见麻雀叽叽喳喳在叫，互相交谈说：“好一位稀客呀！ ”他听了心下好不喜欢。	5
951	我实际上没有露面，可是我一旦露面，那场面可就好看极了。	7
952	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
953	大家都引用那封信里的话，因为里面尽是人们不明白的词儿。	4
954	他的朋友六个星期前都飞往埃及去了，但他耽搁下来，因他和最美丽的芦苇相爱了。	0
955	It is just like being in church.'	4
956	“在远处一条小街上，有一所穷人住的房子。	8
957	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!”	5
958	他当然是爆炸了。	3
959	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
960	他被黄亚麻布裹得紧紧的，用各种香料涂过以防止腐烂。	8
961	于是燕子啄下王子的一只眼睛，衔着飞向那个学生的阁楼去了。	1
962	她在大庭广众前露面的时候,一口气旋转上十九次才熄灭，而且每旋转一次她就往空中抛去七颗粉色的星星。	0
963	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
964	You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose, cried the Student.	7
965	哦，再见,听我说没错，能跟你交谈我很高兴。	4
966	And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.	8
967	And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, 'Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?'	4
968	It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.	0
969	How lucky you mentioned it!	6
970	It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow–trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s–throw away.	0
971	“真是怪事啊！”在铸造车间干活儿的工人监工说，	6
972	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
973	“看看人家快乐王子从 来不为小事哭闹。”	7
974	可是玫瑰树还是揺头。	5
975	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭说着就咳嗽起来了。	6
