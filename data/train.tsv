1	Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring- time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. 	0
2	于是，他轻手轻脚地抱起那孩子，用斗篷把孩子包裹上，免得孩子受冻，然后寻路下山，向村子走去；他的同伴对他的愚蠢行为和好心肠感到很不理解。	0
3	“我从来没有说过我认识他呀，”火箭回答说，	6
4	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
5	She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried the young Student, "but in all my garden there is no red rose."	7
6	“我在寻找我的母亲，”他回答说,“我求求你放我进去，也许她就在这城里呢。”	4
7	年轻的国王大吃一惊，转过身来，看见一个人装扮得像香客，手里拿着一面银镜。	6
8	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
9	年轻的国王听了这番话，不由大叫一声，从梦中醒来；他透过窗户看见黎明那长长的灰指头，紧紧抓着隐去的星星。	6
10	But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
11	那天下午孩子们跑进来时，发现巨人躺在那棵树下死了，身上盖满了白色的鲜花。	1
12	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
13	突然间，他惊讶得直揉眼睛，看了又看。	6
14	可是玫瑰树又摇起头来。	5
15	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
16	于是他悄悄走下楼梯，蹑手蹑脚地打开前门，走出房子，进了花园。	3
17	他把一根尖芦苇刺进疆鼠模糊不清的眼睛，他们在一旁笑起来；他朝麻风病人扔石头，他们也笑个不停。	5
18	“去年夏天，我在河边呆着时,两个野男孩儿，就是磨坊主的儿子，总是用石头砸我。	3
19	Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.	7
20	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
21	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
22	他们伸开瘦巴巴的臂膊，在水里划着沉重的桨。	5
23	'Follow me,' cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.	7
24	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
25	那根光秃秃的牧羊棍儿绽开了花朵儿，素雅的百合花比珍珠还洁白；	0
26	巨人的花园总是冬天，北风、冰雹、霜和雪在树间肆意起舞。	0
27	The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.	7
28	I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.	5
29	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
30	“哎呀！我的儿，”她哭叫道，“我走之前你不吻我吗？	1
31	“他像风向标一样美丽，”一位市议员发表看法说，一心想附庸风雅，“只是不怎么有用处啊。”他找补一句说，生怕人们会认为他不讲究实 际，因为他的确是一个务实的人。	5
32	Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean, said a Bengal Light; "I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister."	2
33	一尊用青铜铸就的那喀索斯国雕像笑容满面，将一面打磨得亮提提的镜子举过头顶。	0
34	The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.	0
35	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, "but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
36	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
37	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
38	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	3
39	所以我一定要离开这里，走遍全世界也要找到她，直到得到她的原谅。”	7
40	“我担心它和我的衣服不配，”她答道，“再说，宫廷大臣的侄子送给我一些真珠宝，谁都知道珠宝要比花草贵重得多呀。”	5
41	She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.	4
42	你肚子里什么都没有，整个儿一个草包。	5
43	You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."	7
44	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
45	'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.	7
46	I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.	4
47	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	5
48	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	0
49	不管怎样，我都希望你在这里定居下来。”	7
50	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
51	年轻的国王拽过来一枝爬上阳台的野藤，折下来，做成一个圆圈，戴在了自己的头上。	0
52	And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.	6
53	他站起来，再看他们，瞧！他们转眼间成了国王和王后了。	6
54	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
55	“为什么呢？真是的。”一朵菊花也跟自己的邻居悄声细语地说。	6
56	原来是捆绑在长棍子端头的目无一切的大火箭在咳嗽。	3
57	可是守城的士兵把手里的矛枪往城门口一横,对他粗鲁地说：“你到城里有什么事？”	2
58	It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.	0
59	What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat, "they really deserve to be drowned." 	5
60	“不必多提，毕竟是你首先心疼我的呀。”兔子说，它转眼就跑走了。	4
61	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
62	“现在这是你们的花园了，小娃娃们，”巨人说他拿起了一把大斧头，把那堵墙砍倒了。	7
63	And the Hare said to him, 'The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.	6
64	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
65	突然，一声尖厉的干咳声传来，他们纷纷四下张望。	6
66	Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.	0
67	“我有许多美丽的花儿，”他说，“可是孩子们才是所有花中最美丽的花朵啊。”	0
68	“今天夜里我要飞往埃及。”燕子说，为飞走一事兴奋不已。	7
69	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
70	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
71	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
72	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
73	I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.	0
74	The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.	4
75	既然你有了机会，你就要充分利用，因为我过不了多一会儿就要回宫中了。	7
76	“你说过，如果我给你帯一朵红玫瑰来，你会陪我跳舞，”大学生喊道，	7
77	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，“这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
78	星孩对他说：“我没有带来。”	1
79	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
80	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
81	“我们的老板！”织工恶狠狠地大声说，	2
82	他们不久就要到那个了不起的国王的墓里去睡觉。	7
83	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
84	快啄一颗出来给他送去吧。	4
85	国宴过后是舞会。	7
86	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
87	In fact, it is essentially suburban.	5
88	He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.	0
89	'Alack, goodman!' she murmured, 'have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?	5
90	Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. 	0
91	“现在我要飞走了！”他嚷道，把身体绷得紧紧的，直直的，	7
92	好像从他被承认的那一刻起，他就对注定会对他的生活发生重大影响的美，显示出种种古怪的激情。	0
93	“这就是我的皇冠。”他回答说。	4
94	Well, really, exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, "why not? It is a most joyful occasion.	0
95	It's quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, "as clear as crystal!" and the King doubled his salary a second time.	0
96	一颗非常明亮而美丽的星星从天上掉下来了。	0
97	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
98	回响带着这绝唱萦绕在山间的紫色洞穴,惊醒了梦中的牧羊人,	6
99	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
100	他确实备受仰慕。	4
101	但她不吃也不喝，只是对樵夫说:“你不是说这孩子是在树林里找到的吗?	6
102	The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.	5
103	You are a very irritating person," said the Rocket, "and very illbred.	2
104	后来，潜水者最后一次从水中上来,他带上来的那颗珍珠比所有的霍尔木兹回的珍珠还漂亮，它像满月那样有模有样,比晨星还耀眼。	0
105	可以肯定的是，老国王弥留之际不知是追悔他的深重罪孽还是打心眼儿里希望他的王国能代代相传，命人去把这个小伙子找来，当着全体大臣的面，指定他是他的继位人。	7
106	But I like arguments, said the Rocket.	0
107	你肯定会看见它们的。”	7
108	As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: "Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!" he said.	6
109	I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."	7
110	他对红雀儿说：“你能在高高的树梢上飞来飞去，能看见全世界。	7
111	他们只好到大路上玩耍，可是路上灰尘太多，而且到处都是粗糙的石头，他们一点也不喜欢在路上玩。	1
112	“什么东西？”她大声问，	6
113	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.'	3
114	星孩把他们领到哪里，他们就跟到哪里，星孩叫他们干什么，他们就干什么。	7
115	Oh! dear no, cried the Rocket.	6
116	比他过去见过的任何东西都要美丽得多。	6
117	他到处寻找，却总找不到魔术师说的那块白金，找啊找啊，从早上找到中午，从中午找到夕阳西下。	1
118	有一次他们陷进了深雪坑,挣脱出来就像正在磨面的磨工那样子白了；有一次他们滑进了池水结冰的光滑冰面上，他们的柴火摔散了捆，他们只好把柴火捡起来，重捆在一起；又有一次他们以为迷了路，心下害怕得要命，因为他们知道雪对任何睡在它们怀里的人都毫不留情。	3
119	“呜呜呜！”狼嗥叫着，两条后腿夹着尾巴慢吞吞地在灌木丛里穿行，“这真是冻死人的鬼天气。	2
120	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
121	It was certainly a magnificent display.	0
122	空气又污浊又沉闷，墙壁湿气淋淋,淌着水流。	5
123	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
124	“不死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
125	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
126	I never said that they had, replied the Rocket; "I said that they might.	7
127	What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.	0
128	然后，他戴上帽子，手里拿着这朵玫瑰花儿，向教授的住宅跑去。	5
129	巨人最爱那小男孩儿，因为小男孩儿亲吻过他。	4
130	巨人对所有孩子都非常和蔼，可他仍一心想念他的第一个小朋友,经常说起他。	7
131	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
132	There was no doubt about it.	4
133	但是那麻风病人苦苦哀求，星孩于是对他起了善心，把黄金送给他了。	4
134	The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. 	0
135	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
136	It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. 	7
137	“你们在这里干什么？”他喊叫道,声音很霸道，孩子们赶紧跑散了。	2
138	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
139	他等新娘等了整整一年，新娘终于到来了。	7
140	You must certainly see them."	7
141	它从天边一路往下落，途中路过了许多别的星星；他们惊奇地看着它下落，他们好像看见它落在离小羊圈不远一簇柳树后面了。	6
142	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，“不过这也不出我所料。	2
143	Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.	5
144	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
145	死亡又大笑起来，用手指吹响口哨,一个女人从天而降。	0
146	A new arrival, I see! said the Frog.	6
147	他不准许任何人虐待鸟儿和野兽，而是教人懂得爱、亲情和仁慈；他向穷人发放面包，向衣不蔽体的人发放衣服，在他的国土上，到处一片祥和富足的景象。	4
148	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
149	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
150	所以你还是离开这里，别再让我看见你。”	5
151	Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.'	7
152	跟我走吧,我的儿子，我需要你的爰哪。”	4
153	So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.	6
154	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
155	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
156	But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
157	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	4
158	野猪在山谷里拱吃玉米的根，狐狸咬断山间的葡萄藤。	3
159	“我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
160	但是，瞧！他走过城门时，卫兵们点头哈腰向他行礼，说：“我们的君主多么美啊！”一群市民追随在他身后，大声嚷叫说：“这全世界都没有这么美的人啊！”	0
161	Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.	0
162	Good heavens! cried the Goose.	6
163	宫殿的门开了，神父们和城里的大臣纷纷跑来迎候他，在他面前阿谀奉承，说:“你就是我们一直久候的君主，我们国王的骄子啊。”	7
164	'Nay,' said the Star–Child, 'but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.'	5
165	“这位做梦能手在哪里？”他们高声叫道，	2
166	The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company.	7
167	那是第二天就要举行加冕典礼的那天夜晚，年轻的国王独自坐在他的美丽的宫室里。	0
168	可是你们这些人谁都没有感情。	5
169	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
170	他还没有张开翅膀，第三滴水又掉了下来，他抬头一看，只见——唔！天哪, 他看见了什么？	6
171	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.	2
172	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
173	What a curious shape you are!	6
174	“我们饿得不行了！ ”他们叹道。	3
175	She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.	4
176	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
177	人们在十二点钟去市场时，发现巨人在他们见过的最美丽的花园里和孩子们玩耍。	0
178	但是谁都不敢看他的脸，只因他的脸像天使的圣容。	4
179	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
180	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
181	The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. 	2
182	瞧，要是你能像牛一样犁地，像马一样拉车，像柯利狗一样看护羊群，那你才算得上个人物呢。”	5
183	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
184	How should I know?'	5
185	他立即进了门，把那孩子塞进她的怀里；她亲过孩子，把他放在他们家最小的孩子躺着的小床上。	0
186	然而贪婪攥紧手，咬紧牙关。	4
187	But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.	5
188	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
189	“这真是一场可笑的恋爱别的燕子都叽叽喳喳地说，“瞧那芦苇不趁钱,亲戚倒有一大群。”这倒是实情，河里到处长满了芦苇。	5
190	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
191	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
192	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
193	And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, 'My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?'	6
194	What are fireworks like? she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.	7
195	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
196	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
197	你认为今天下午会有雨吗？	7
198	And the Star–Child frowned and said to himself, 'What is this that they say to me?	6
199	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
200	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
201	我会在月光下用音乐孕育一朵,用我自己的心血把它染红。	7
202	You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow, said the Giant.	7
203	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
204	“不吻，”星孩说，“你的样子太脏,我能吻蛭蛇和癞蛤蟆都不会吻你。”	5
205	三年中他就这样在世界上寻找，这世界既没人爱他，也没人怜悯他或对他慈悲,可是这个世界正是他春风得意时为自己创造的啊。	1
206	“我歌唱的东西，他受不了,我欢喜的东西，在他是痛苦。	2
207	Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.	5
208	玫瑰树顶端的花枝绽开了一朵奇异的玫瑰花，花瓣儿连着花瓣儿，就像歌儿连着歌儿。	6
209	'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with, but, of course, that is not my fault.	5
210	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
211	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
212	每天他都在城堡屋顶上劈劈啪啪下三个小时，把屋顶上大多数瓦片都打破了；随后他又在花园转呀转呀，忙不迭地奔啊跑啊。	1
213	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
214	Hallo! cried one of the boys, "look at this old stick! I wonder how it came here"; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.	6
215	There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.	4
216	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
217	After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.	6
218	他的同伴们追随他，因为他漂亮，腿脚快，能跳舞，会吹奏，写曲子。	0
219	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
220	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
221	你们怎么能说我生得美丽呢？	6
222	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
223	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
224	“我要去'死神殿'了。	3
225	船长见状哈哈大笑，伸岀手把那颗珍珠拿起来，端详过后，他把珍珠按在额头,鞠了一躬。	0
226	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说：“快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
227	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
228	The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.	6
229	Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.	7
230	但是星孩听不进去他们的话，皱起眉头一副不屑一顾的样子，他跑回同伴中间,带领他们玩耍。	5
231	“嗨哟嗨哟！ ”他们每拽出一只箱子就喊一声。	4
232	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
233	How happy we are here! they cried to each other.	0
234	有谁关心过咱们？	1
235	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
236	Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.	7
237	“快让我看看，瞧瞧这家要什么没什么，我们需要的东西太多了。”	7
238	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
239	'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.	7
240	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
241	I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.	7
242	她的脸色苍白异常，她坐着雪橇穿过街心时，所有的人都暗暗惊奇。	6
243	印度一些设防的城市里流行饥荒，撤马尔罕的水塘耗干了。	1
244	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
245	And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.	6
246	The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.	0
247	天气冷得岀奇，连动物和鸟儿都不知道怎样对付下去了。	3
248	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
249	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
250	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
251	He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.	7
252	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
253	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
254	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
255	But the girl frowned.	5
256	一个人从人群里走岀来，恶狠狠地跟他说：“老爷，难道你不明白穷人的生活仰仗富人的奢侈吗？	2
257	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
258	For a red rose? they cried, "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	5
259	许多年过去了,巨人年纪很大很大了,身体衰老得不行。	1
260	“明天我的朋友都会飞往‘第二大瀑布’了。	7
261	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
262	母亲，我当初拒绝了你。	1
263	七年期间，他把想说的话都说了，因为他的谈话是有限的，于是他决意返回他自己的城堡来。	7
264	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
265	All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."	5
266	“国王的花园算不上世界,你这傻爆筒，”一个大焰火筒说，“世界是一个大得不能再大的地方，你花上三天时间把它看遍就不错了。	2
267	他早先去拜访他的朋友、康沃尔的吃人魔去了，和吃人魔一呆就是七年。	3
268	Why! 	6
269	樵夫和他老伴儿走岀家门，喊来星孩,对他说：“快到家里来，你这下找到你妈妈了，她正在等你呢。”	7
270	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
271	这时有一个人偶然瞧见了他。	6
272	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
273	The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.	0
274	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
275	他把他那棕色的髯发从额头往后梳理一下,拿起古琵琶，手指在弦上随意弹动。	0
276	“你有什么话捎往埃及吗？”他大声说，“我马上要飞走了。”	7
277	高兴起来吧。	0
278	凡是陪他去留给他使用的那套房间的人，都经常提到他一看见为他准备的精美衣服和大量珠宝快活得脱口惊叫；提到他脱掉他那身粗糙的皮束，腰外衣和破旧的羊皮长袍时欣喜若狂的样子。	6
279	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
280	一些别的奴隶从船舷好奇地探视着。	6
281	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
282	You had really better keep yourself dry, said the Fire-balloon.	4
283	Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?'	7
284	他们一脸饥饿相，瘦弱的手哆嗦个不停。	1
285	“我不会仅仅由于他不注意听就不跟他说话。	7
286	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
287	He said to the Mole, 'Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother there?'	3
288	国王说：“这就是你的母亲，你用泪水清洗了她的脚。”	0
289	The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. 	0
290	他穿着漂亮的王服，站立在他们面前，风琴弹岀了乐曲，号手吹响了他们的号角，童子唱起了圣诗。	0
291	他于是走到水井旁，往下看去，瞧呀!他的脸果真像癞蛤蟆的脸，他的身上像蛭蛇一样长满了鳞片。	3
292	来和我一起玩儿吧，我不会取笑你的。”	4
293	And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	0
294	But nobody saw him.	1
295	他在所有事情上都左右着他们，他们都变得铁石心肠，和他完全一样。	5
296	所以你别哭了。	4
297	我这件皇袍是悲伤的织机织的，是痛苦的苍白的手织的。	1
298	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,' and they drave him out of the garden.	2
299	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
300	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
301	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.	5
302	每逢他走过村庄，村里的孩子们就取笑他，朝他扔石头，赶马车的人甚至不让他睡在马厩里，生怕他会把存放在里面的玉米弄霉了，他看上去太令人恶心了，连雇工都赶他走，没有人怜悯他。	5
303	“多么可爱的一小块玻璃啊！”小姑娘惊叫道,随后她一路笑着跑回家去了。	6
304	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
305	快快离开这里，我们可受不了你和我们一起玩耍了。”他们一起把他赶出了花园。	5
306	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
307	In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.	6
308	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
309	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“难道你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	7
310	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
311	OLD Stick! said the Rocket, "impossible! GOLD Stick, that is what he said.	6
312	小侍从见了吃了一惊，瞪起他那蓝蓝的大眼睛，微笑着跟他说：“陛下，我看你有皇袍和权杖，可你的皇冠在哪里呢？	6
313	太阳落山时他只好朝家的方向走去，哭得伤心极了，因为他知道什么命运在等着他。	1
314	But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, 'Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill–favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.	5
315	Romance is a thing of the past."	1
316	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
317	Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
318	Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.	0
319	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
320	他又抽泣起来，说：“母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
321	“办法倒是有的，”玫瑰树回答说,“可是那办法太可怕，我都不敢告诉你。”	3
322	He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.	5
323	When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.	0
324	我生养了六个美丽的女儿，我很担心狗鱼碰见她们。	3
325	Why, you don't even know him, growled the Roman Candle.	5
326	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
327	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
328	If you want a red rose, said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.	5
329	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
330	市政文书赶紧把这项提议记了下来。	4
331	她捶打着她那不育的胸脯,大声哭叫起来。	2
332	奴隶们赤身裸体，只缠着一块破腰布,每个人都用铁链与相邻的人拴在一起。	3
333	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
334	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
335	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
336	So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.	6
337	那是十年前的今天吗？”	6
338	瞧这冷风一个劲儿往屋里刮，我都冻死了。”	3
339	'That was kind of you,' said Hans, 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'	4
340	We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.	0
341	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
342	How I would like to see him! he used to say.	7
343	And the Linnet answered, 'Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
344	They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.	2
345	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
346	In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.	7
347	It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.	0
348	'Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'	6
349	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
350	我不是你的儿子，用不着听你说三道四。”	2
351	帆船船长把绳梯从船侧扔下海去，把绳梯的另一头紧紧地拴在两根铁支柱子上。	4
352	And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.	4
353	Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."	0
354	“她不懂得跟人说话，”他说，“我担心她就是一个轻佻女子，看她风一来就摇晃的轻浮样儿。"	5
355	“富人和穷人难道不是兄弟吗？”年轻的国王问。	6
356	In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.	4
357	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
358	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
359	She would not sacrifice herself for others.	5
360	山谷底上的稀泥里爬岀许多龙和长着鳞片的可怕东西，豺在沙滩上跑来跑去,不时用鼻孔在空气里闻嗅。	5
361	只有花园里的自私巨人还过着严冬的日子。	5
362	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
363	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
364	For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.	0
365	The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain–Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice–King had kissed her.	6
366	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。”	3
367	If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.	7
368	You certainly are! cried the Bengal Light.	6
369	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
370	接着冰雹停止了在头顶砰砰乱跳，北风不再呼呼吼叫,一股扑鼻的香气从开着的窗扉飘到了他跟前。	0
371	But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
372	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
373	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
374	It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.	0
375	樵夫这时在附近一个木料场里砍木头，看见了星孩的所作所为，就跑过来训斥他说：“你真是铁石心肠，一点不知可怜人，这个可怜的女人究竟干了什么坏事惹了你，你这样对待他？”	2
376	你是老几，竟敢给上帝的世界带来痛苦？	2
377	And who giveth us food?'	3
378	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
379	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
380	“负情！”那姑娘说，	5
381	你和我们有什么关系？我们受苦与你有何相干？”	5
382	据说那个墓穴里还躺着一个人，死者是一个异常英俊美丽的青年，他的双手用绳子反绑着，胸部被捅了很多刀，衣服都被血染红了。	3
383	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
384	他站在了耶稣像前，他的右手和左手都是精美的金制器皿、盛着葡萄酒的圣餐杯和盛着圣油的玻璃杯。	0
385	他身穿王服站在那里，上帝的荣耀无处不在，雕琢的壁龛里的圣徒们好像动弹起来了。	4
386	那确实是一幕让人惊喜的景色。	0
387	“这颗明珠，”他说，“将镶嵌在年轻国王的权杖上。”他挥手示意黑人们起锚开船。	7
388	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。”	2
389	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
390	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
391	But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.	6
392	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
393	枯干的刺儿开了花，开出的红玫瑰比红宝石还艳红，	0
394	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
395	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你又寸待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
396	王后对他说：“这是你曾救助过的你的亲生父亲。”	0
397	”他气得满脸通红，对他们说：“我就是国王。”他把他们的矛戟挡到一边，闯了进去。	2
398	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
399	但是，天哪！斗篷里面没有金子，也没有银子，当然也没有什么宝贝，只有一个小孩儿睡在里面。	6
400	The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.	5
401	他觉得他在一片昏暗的林子里闲荡,上挂满了奇怪的果子和美丽的毒花儿。	3
402	So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.	6
403	If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.	7
404	“在战争中，”织工回答说，“强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
405	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, "I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
406	想来可怜,声音美管什么用，没有什么实际用处。”	5
407	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?'	3
408	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
409	I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.	4
410	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, 'Why art thou watching me?	2
411	“别呀，”他大声说，笑起来，“我们何必不把这丑东西当奴隶卖了，他的身价还够一碗甜酒的钱吧。”	5
412	巨人悄悄地站在他身后，轻轻地把他拿在手里，放在了树上。	4
413	他真心为他过去的行为感到后悔。	1
414	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
415	I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion, said the Rocket; "no doubt that is what it means," and he looked more supercilious than ever.	5
416	What an honour! cried all the courtiers.	6
417	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
418	“她有模有样，”他边自言自语，边从树林穿过去------“这是没法否定她的,可是她有感情吗？	5
419	我就不喜欢那些对着洒了一地牛奶哭嚎的人。	5
420	街上突然传来一阵闹哄哄的喧嚣，那些宫廷大员来势汹汹闯了进来，他们手中的剑已出鞘，盾牌闪着金属的光泽，头上的冠羽摇来晃去。	3
421	At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.	7
422	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
423	“那你还哭什么？”燕子问道，“你快把我浇透了。”	5
424	It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.	5
425	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
426	但是她并没有消气，反而取笑他，越说气越大，最后哭泣道：“我们的孩子都没有面包吃，我们还养得起别人的孩子吗？	2
427	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
428	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
429	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
430	May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?	6
431	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
432	到处都是刺鼻难闻的气味。	5
433	那女人就回答他：“我是你的母亲呀。”	4
434	He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.	1
435	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	4
436	“一位远比我伟大的人为你加冕了啊！”他高声赞叹着，在年轻的国王面前跪了下来。	0
437	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
438	After the banquet there was to be a Ball.	7
439	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
440	“你在这幢房子里竟说出这样的话？”年轻的国王说，他大步走过主教,走上祭坛的台阶，站在耶稣像的前面。	6
441	Get thee gone.	2
442	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
443	“天哪！”小爆筒说，“我过去想得正好相反，以为我是沾了王子的光才被燃放的。	6
444	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
445	第二天，他走进土牢对星孩皱起眉头，说：“在这邪教徒城门附近一个树林里，放着三块金子。	5
446	人们肃然起敬，纷纷跪了下来，宫廷大员们赶快把剑收进鞘里，俯首称臣，主教的脸顿时变得惨白，双手抖动不止。	3
447	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
448	还不如冻死在树林里好呢，要么让什么野兽撞上咱们，吃了也行啊。	3
449	“跟我来吧。”兔子大声招呼说。随后穿过树林，来到一个水塘边。	4
450	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
451	一个女人罩着黄面纱,缓缓地跟在一峰骆驼后面，时不时回过身来张望那具死尸。	5
452	'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'	4
453	这是一幕可爱的景色，只有花园的一隅还是冬天。	0
454	They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.	0
455	但是他的小伙伴一见他走来，纷纷嘲笑他说：“喂，你像癞蛤蟆一样肮脏，像蛭蛇一样可恶啰。	5
456	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."	2
457	神父们和大臣们纷纷跪下，对他说：“从前有人曾预言过，今天会有人来统治我们的。	7
458	Dear me! said the little Squib, "I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."	6
459	于是星孩跟着兔子去了，瞧！在一棵老橡树的裂缝里，他看见了他正在寻找的那块白金。	6
460	但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。	0
461	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
462	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
463	Whenever we appear we excite great attention.	0
464	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
465	TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED	3
466	但是孩子们一看见他，吓得胆战心惊，纷纷逃跑了,花园又变成了冬天。	3
467	Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has, and she got up from her chair and went into the house.	5
468	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
469	巨人欣喜若狂地跑下楼梯，岀了房子冲进花园。	0
470	Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.	0
471	他穿着一身灰色服装，他吐出的气跟冰差不多。	1
472	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky."	0
473	He is too selfish, she said.	5
474	星孩回答他们说：“我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
475	“我们当然还得另铸一尊塑像，”他说，“那应该是我自己的塑像。”	6
476	他跑进家门，既惊奇又惊喜。	6
477	这时樵夫的小女儿走到他身边，把手搭在他肩上，说：“即使你真的失去了你的美貌，那又有什么关系呢？	4
478	星孩回答说：“我在寻找一块藏在这里的黄金，我要是找不到它，我的主人会打我，把我当奴隶使唤的。”	1
479	已经是冬天了，”燕子回答说，“这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	3
480	老主教看见他身穿牧羊装进来，从教座上惊讶地站起来，赶过去迎住他，对他说：“孩子啊，这就是国王的行头吗？我用什么皇冠来给你加冕？我拿什么权杖递交你手中？今天一定是你的欢乐日，一定不该是你的屈辱日吧。”	6
481	He saw a most wonderful sight. 	6
482	'I am seeking for my mother,' he answered, 'and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.'	7
483	“不！ ”孩子回答说，“这是爱的伤痕呀。”	4
484	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？”	2
485	“喂！”一个男孩儿叫道，“快看这根旧棍子！多奇怪，它怎么到这里来了？”他从水沟里捡起火箭。	6
486	I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.	7
487	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
488	那些跑掉的孩子，看出来巨人不再像过去那样坏，又都跑回来，春天也跟着孩子们来了。	0
489	雪往草地盖上了她那巨大的白色斗篷，霜把所有的树都涂上了银色。	0
490	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
491	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
492	It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet, and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.	6
493	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
494	And when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.	7
495	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。”	3
496	“他的脚边还有一只死鸟！”市长继续说，	6
497	Well, good-bye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you."	0
498	”这块土地是自由的，”年轻的国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”	0
499	太阳西下时，他坐在地上哭起来，可就在哭泣时，他从陷阱里救上来的小兔子来到了他的跟前。小兔子跟他说：“你哭什么？	1
500	What a curious shape you are!	6
501	那麻风病人也把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。”	7
502	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说：“他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
503	“我们真得发表一份告示，禁止鸟类死在这里。”	7
504	来呀，我们把她赶走,因为她好丑好难看哪。”	5
505	“我知道我会飞得比星星还高，比月亮还高，比太阳还高。	7
506	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，”她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂，	1
507	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:“我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
508	That is what is called sympathy.	4
509	I had thoughts of entering public life once myself, remarked the Duck; "there are so many things that need reforming.	4
510	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
511	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
512	“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, "every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."	4
513	可是士兵们嘲笑他，其中一个甩着黑胡子，放下手里的盾，大声说：“说真的，你的母亲见了你也不会感到快乐，因为你这副样子比沼泽地的癞蛤蟆还令人恶心，比水草地里乱爬的蛭蛇还令人害怕。	5
514	老人往他面前的一个木盘子里放了一些发霉的面包说：“吃吧，”又往一个杯子里倒了些稍带咸味的水，说：“喝吧”。	5
515	Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.	7
516	There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.	5
517	“我根本不这样看，”鸭子说，“我看这对别人一点用处也没有。	5
518	And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.	4
519	And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.	6
520	What a pity!	1
521	他们把我赶岀了城门，谁都不管我的死活。”	2
522	我们和那些辛辛苦苦为我们劳作的人有什么关系？一个人非得亲眼看见播种的人才可以吃面包吗？一个人非得和踩榨葡萄酒的人交谈过才可以喝葡萄酒吗？”	2
523	“那你还是不哭的好。”	4
524	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
525	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
526	老头儿从缠头布上取下一块花绸布，蒙在星孩的眼睛上，推操着往前面走。	3
527	他一点儿也不可怜穷人，对瞎子、残疾人和有病有灾的人，一点儿也不知怜悯，反而朝他们扔石头，硬把他们往大路上赶，要他们到别的地方要饭吃。于是，除了不法之徒，别人不敢再到村里来讨吃讨喝。	5
528	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
529	“是一个像我自己一样的人。	4
530	'Well, for my own part,' said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, 'I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.	4
531	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
532	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
533	“要是你真的是我的生身母亲，”他说，“那你还是离去的好，别在这儿让我丢脸，你瞧我原以为我是某颗星星的孩子,而不是一个叫花子的孩子，像你和我说的那样。	2
534	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
535	我要走遍天下去寻找她，不找到她决不罢休。”	7
536	“这位穿戴得像一个乞丐的国王在哪里------就是给我们王国带来耻辱的男孩儿？我们一定要杀了他,他根本不配统治我们。”	2
537	“我自己的花园就是我自己的花园，”巨人说，“谁都明白这个理儿，我以后不让任何人来玩儿，我自己想怎么玩儿都行。”	7
538	“他们是我的仆人。”她回答说。	4
539	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
540	The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.	0
541	这片树林从外面看去非常漂亮，好像到处都是欢唱的鸟儿，到处都是温馨的花朵，星孩满心高兴地走了进去。	0
542	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
543	“我们用它来烧火吧！”另一个男孩儿说，“水壶里的水能快点开。”	7
544	“明天晚上王子要举行舞会年轻的大学生嘟哝道，“我的情人会做我的舞伴儿。	7
545	百合花比精选的珍珠还白净啊，百合花的茎比银子还纏亮。	0
546	他变得越来越骄傲、残忍和自私。樵夫的孩子也好，村里别人家的孩子也罢，他一概不放在眼里，说他们都是低贱的父母生养的，只有他高贵无比，是从一颗星那里蹦出来的，他在孩子们中间称王称霸，把他们称为他的仆人。	5
547	“多么奇怪的现象，”鸟类学教授走过桥时说，	6
548	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
549	“得了，你根本就不认识他焰火筒嗷嗷回击说。	5
550	I don't understand you, answered the Water-rat.	5
551	那棵可怜的树仍然盖满了霜和雪，北风呼呼地吹，在树梢上呜呜地叫。	1
552	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
553	但是正在他们互相哀叹他们的痛苦时，一件怪事发生了。	6
554	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
555	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
556	因此还是回你的宫殿去，把紫袍穿起来，把细亚麻穿起来。	0
557	We will go to sleep now, they said, "and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled"; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.	7
558	I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.	1
559	“我一直表现得多么自私啊！"他说，现在我明白了为什么舂天不到这里来了。	5
560	我要去寻找我的女儿去了。	7
561	一点儿不假，他对美崇拜有加，对弱者和生病的人一概嘲弄,极尽挖苦之能事。	5
562	“哦，真的，”一枚流星火花大声应道，“为什么要不高兴呢？这正是找乐子的机会，我飞上蓝天时，还打算把这一切都告诉星星呢。	6
563	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
564	What a strange thing! said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.	6
565	黑人们耸了耸肩，把尸体扔下了船。	5
566	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
567	因此，快让我们的君主戴上这顶皇冠，拿上这根权杖，以我们国王的公正和慈悲来统治我们吧。”	0
568	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
569	Good-bye, cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.	0
570	恐怕是没有。	5
571	In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.	7
572	“一个家有了铁石心肠，还能不总刮来冷风吗？”他问道。	5
573	他们终于脱险，因此高兴得不知怎么才好，哈哈大笑起来，大地在他们看来像一朵银花，月亮则像一朵金花。	0
574	There is no good talking to him, said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; "no good at all, for he has gone away."	6
575	“大冬天还有燕子！ ”	6
576	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
577	“嘿呀，多么奇妙的运气！”他惊叫道，“这里有一朵红玫瑰！我一生中从来没有看见过这样的玫瑰花儿。	6
578	看哪！阳光从彩色窗户照射进来，光束在他身上编织了一件绢袍，比那件为他快乐而编织的皇袍还精美；	6
579	可朝臣听完三个梦后彼此面面相觑,纷纷耳语说：“他一定是疯了，梦就是梦，幻觉就是幻觉，这哪儿是哪儿？	6
580	一个样子凶恶的老头儿正好路过，大声吆喝说：“我出这个价买下他。”他把钱付清后，领着星孩进了城。	3
581	苦难在一大早就把我们弄醒，耻辱夜里和我们坐在一起。	1
582	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.'	2
583	I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.	5
584	Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.	6
585	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.'	4
586	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
587	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
588	”他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
589	“我拿着三颗玉米粒，”她回答说,你问这干什么？”	6
590	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任又寸目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
591	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
592	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
593	In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.	0
594	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
595	“快去那个城市把那两件最珍贵的东西给我捡来。”上帝对他的一个天使说,天使给他拣来了那颗铅心和那只死鸟。	7
596	“你说的是实话，”樵夫回答说，“可是我在树林里发现你时对你动了恻隐之心。”	4
597	Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."	5
598	只有那个小男孩儿没有跑掉，因为他的眼睛里满是泪水，没有看见巨人走了过来。	1
599	随后他开始感到全身上下一阵奇怪的刺痛。	3
600	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
601	He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.	5
602	“再见了，亲爰的王子！”他小声说，“你能让我亲亲你的手吗？ ”	7
603	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
604	船头上坐着一个弄鲨人，不厌其烦地敲着一面鼓。	0
605	他是一个非常自私的巨人。	5
606	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
607	I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun. 	7
608	实际上，我要高高地飞到------”	7
609	Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. 	0
610	“他太自私了。”秋天说。	5
611	他也算是一个政治家了，在地方选举中还总能居领先地位，因此对议会的一套行话了如指掌。	4
612	What a delightful voice you have! cried the Frog.	0
613	The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.	0
614	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
615	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
616	我要把那个可怜的小男孩儿抱到那棵树顶上去，然后我再把这围墙拆掉，让我的花园世世代代成为孩子们的游戏场。”	7
617	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	7
618	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
619	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
620	如果你不穿上国王的服装,那人们怎么才能知道你是一个国王呢？”	6
621	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
622	Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do."	5
623	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
624	多么可怕的灾难！	3
625	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
626	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
627	if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.	0
628	年轻的国王大叫一声醒来，瞧！他在他自己的寝宫里，透过窗户他看见一轮蜜黄色明月悬在暗淡的天空。	3
629	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	3
630	'And what signs didst thou find with him?' she cried.	7
631	“你原来一直在跟我调情啊。”他大声说，	6
632	I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.'	7
633	但是他们不让进，还用他们的长矛刺他。	2
634	I hope not, said the Frog complacently.	7
635	死亡大笑，拿起一块黑石头，扔进了森林，一片野毒芹丛里走岀身着火焰长袍的热病。	5
636	瞧你只是个叫花子，丑陋不堪，穿得破破烂烂。	5
637	星孩一看她走了，心下欢喜，赶紧去找他可以一起玩耍的小伙伴去了。	0
638	Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. 	6
639	“什么是敏感的人？”爆竹问焰火筒说。	6
640	It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.	0
641	主教听了他的三个梦，眉头皱起来,说：“我的孩子，我是一个老人，已是花甲暮年，大千世界里发生过的许多恶行,我见得多了。	5
642	今天你去给我把那块白金拿来,要是你拿不来，那我准会让你挨上一百鞭子。	2
643	她的衣服破破烂烂，因为在粗粝的路上行走脚磨得血淋淋的，样子非常狼狈。	5
644	 I shall never get over it."	1
645	啊!	6
646	他说话的声音非常缓慢,但很清晰，仿佛在口授研究报告，他总是俯视着他的说话对象。	4
647	你母亲没有住在这个城里。”	1
648	于是燕子在城市上空飞翔，看见富人在他们美丽的宅邸寻欢作乐，而乞丐坐在大门前行乞。	5
649	因为我不认自己的母亲,把她赶走，傲慢无礼，对她冷酷无情。	5
650	可是星孩说：“不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
651	“那就跟我来吧，”兔子说，“我带你去找到它，我知道它藏在哪里，也知道为什么藏在那里。	7
652	But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.	4
653	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
654	他们走到村边时，他的同伴对他说:“你得到了孩子，那就快把斗篷给我吧,曰:星孩既然是一起看见的，就应平分才对。	4
655	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
656	但是他一弄明白是谁在等他后，冷嘲热讽地笑道:“得了，我母亲在哪里呢？我只看见这个脏臭的要饭女人呀。	5
657	请你给我爰吧。	4
658	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
659	我永远都对付不了这种事。”	3
660	He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.	0
661	我也许会回到宫廷去，因为我知道我命中注定要给这世界带来轰动。”	7
662	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
663	The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.	5
664	I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled.	4
665	What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good."	5
666	他看见一幕美不胜收的景致：	0
667	He must have a truly romantic nature, said the Catherine Wheel, "for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about"; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.	6
668	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
669	I don't think much of that, said the Duck, "as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
670	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
671	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说：“这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
672	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道,	2
673	And he bound the eyes of the Star–Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.	6
674	You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'	7
675	Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.'	7
676	他过去从来没有如此急切地,或说如此狂喜地感受到诸多美丽的东西的魔力和真谛。	0
677	That is the new method.	7
678	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
679	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
680	当然当然,我知道一谈到有趣的话题，就准有人横加打断。	5
681	I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.	7
682	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
683	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
684	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
685	他们搂住他的脖子亲吻他，把他带进了宫殿,给他穿上漂亮的衣服，把皇冠戴上他的头，把权杖放入他手中，他于是统治了这个临河的城市，成为一城之主。	6
686	And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.	5
687	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	5
688	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
689	它们是用珍贵的蓝宝石做的，是一千年前从印度买来的蓝宝石呢。	6
690	A horrible odour filled the place. 	5
691	秋天给每一座花园带来了金色的果实,但是巨人的花园却得不到秋天的垂青。	1
692	Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.	6
693	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
694	花园里唯一感到高兴的人是雪和霜。	0
695	红雀儿回答说：“你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
696	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
697	到处都是刺鼻难闻的气味。	5
698	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
699	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
700	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
701	那位香客回答说：“看看这面镜子,你会看见他的。“	7
702	指望别人像自己一样非凡，这显然是不公道的。	5
703	空气又污浊又沉闷，墙壁湿气淋淋,淌着水流。	5
704	However, I excuse your ignorance.	4
705	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
706	As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.	0
707	他还很幼小,没法儿爬上树的枝杈，正围着那棵树转啊转啊，哭得伤心极了。	1
708	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
709	I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out.	0
710	The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.	0
711	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
712	And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.	7
713	我们种下玉米，我们的餐桌上却没有吃的。	1
714	Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.	6
715	Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?	7
716	“我早知道我会制造一起特大轰动的。”火箭喘着气说，然后熄灭了。	7
717	他一回来就看见孩子们在花园里玩耍。	0
718	This is a delightful spot, he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." 	0
719	He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.	0
720	Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.	7
721	It certainly was a marvellous sight. 	0
722	他抽搐了一阵儿，接着就一动不动了。	3
723	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
724	Do it no harm.	4
725	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
726	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	4
727	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
728	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
729	Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.	6
730	我吃了很多苦才找到了你啊。”	1
731	“我多希望能穿上新衣服参加这次盛大舞会啊。”她附和说，“我定好了在衣服上绣西番莲的,可是那个女裁缝懒死了。”	5
732	他发沉的眼睑垂了下来，一种少有的消沉一下子支配了他。	1
733	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶哪。”	1
734	Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.	6
735	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
736	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
737	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
738	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
739	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
740	你今天晚上会听见我们合唱俱乐部的演唱。	7
741	埃及设防的城市里也流行饥荒，蝗虫是从大荒漠里出来的。	1
742	And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.	0
743	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
744	“啊呀，老公啊！”她嘟哝说，“难道我们自家的孩子还不够多，你非要捡一个弃儿往咱炉边挤吗？	2
745	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
746	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
747	“跟青蛙说话没劲,一只蜻蜓说,他落在一株大棕色宽叶香蒲上，“一点劲也没有，瞧他竟然走开了。”	6
748	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	6
749	After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. 	7
750	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
751	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	4
752	这乐曲在他耳际萦绕，妙不可言，他原以为一定是国王的乐师演奏着曲子走过。	0
753	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
754	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
755	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
756	他们俩有一个比同伴跑得快，抢先从柳树中穿过去，从另一边跑岀来，瞧！白雪里真的有一样金玩意儿。	6
757	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
758	She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.	0
