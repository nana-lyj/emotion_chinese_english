1	Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
2	Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; "but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.	1
3	I hope not, said the Frog complacently.	7
4	兔子回答他说：“你确实给我自由了，可我拿什么报答你呢？”	7
5	那天下午孩子们跑进来时，发现巨人躺在那棵树下死了，身上盖满了白色的鲜花。	1
6	He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.	8
7	尽管今天是我的加冕典礼，可我不会用它们的。	8
8	Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.	7
9	他们只好到大路上玩耍，可是路上灰尘太多，而且到处都是粗糙的石头，他们一点也不喜欢在路上玩。	1
10	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
11	Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring- time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. 	0
12	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
13	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
14	那棵可怜的树仍然盖满了霜和雪，北风呼呼地吹，在树梢上呜呜地叫。	1
15	于是，他轻手轻脚地抱起那孩子，用斗篷把孩子包裹上，免得孩子受冻，然后寻路下山，向村子走去；他的同伴对他的愚蠢行为和好心肠感到很不理解。	0
16	我们和那些辛辛苦苦为我们劳作的人有什么关系？一个人非得亲眼看见播种的人才可以吃面包吗？一个人非得和踩榨葡萄酒的人交谈过才可以喝葡萄酒吗？”	2
17	“一位远比我伟大的人为你加冕了啊！”他高声赞叹着，在年轻的国王面前跪了下来。	0
18	Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.	7
19	母亲，我当初拒绝了你。	1
20	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
21	How I would like to see him! he used to say.	7
22	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
23	For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.	8
24	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
25	巨人最爱那小男孩儿，因为小男孩儿亲吻过他。	4
26	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
27	But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.	3
28	然后他们穿过许多条街道，来到一道小门前，开小门的这面墙被一棵石榴树遮掩着。	8
29	他是一个非常自私的巨人。	5
30	所以你还是离开这里，别再让我看见你。”	5
31	只见她额头写着“瘟疫”二字，一群精瘦的秃鹰在她身边盘旋。	3
32	他于是把他的三个梦讲了出来。	8
33	if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.	0
34	从前，两个穷樵夫在一片广袤的松权寸林里寻路回家。	8
35	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
36	但是贪婪摇了摇头。	8
37	It is really too dreadful!	3
38	Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.	7
39	他也打听不到他母亲也就是那个要饭女人的一点消息，尽管他在世界上寻找了三年，也往往好像看见她就在前面的路上走，便呼喊她,在她身后紧追不舍，尖利的石片把他的脚割得血淋淋的。	3
40	巨龟在热泥中躺着睡觉。	8
41	每一棵树上他都看见有一个小孩儿。	8
42	枯干的刺儿开了花，开出的红玫瑰比红宝石还艳红，	0
43	“是的，”那人回答说，“可这位富兄弟的名字是该隐。”	8
44	所以你别哭了。	4
45	”这块土地是自由的，”年轻的国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”	0
46	Romance never dies.	7
47	But nobody saw him.	1
48	但是，瞧！他走过城门时，卫兵们点头哈腰向他行礼，说：“我们的君主多么美啊！”一群市民追随在他身后，大声嚷叫说：“这全世界都没有这么美的人啊！”	0
49	丝绸床罩上绣着淡白罂粟花，仿佛它们是从入睡者疲劳的手里落下来的；高高的槽形象牙细柱子把天鹅绒华盖支撑起来，华盖上翻上去一束束硕大的鸵鸟羽毛，如白色泡沫，直指银白色的回纹装饰天花板。	8
50	But none of you have any hearts.	5
51	那是一片荒凉的墓地，位于城外。	3
52	“给我一粒吧，”死亡说，“我把它种在花园里；只要一颗，我马上就走。”	7
53	小松鼠生活在局杉树洞里，不停地互相蹭鼻子保持暖和,兔子在他们的窝里蜷成一团，根本不敢贸然到窝口来探头探脑。	3
54	Quack, quack, quack, she said.	8
55	你赶快出发吧，太阳快下山时我会在花园门口等你的。	7
56	他站在了耶稣像前，他的右手和左手都是精美的金制器皿、盛着葡萄酒的圣餐杯和盛着圣油的玻璃杯。	0
57	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
58	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
59	What an honour! cried all the courtiers.	6
60	“这位做梦能手在哪里？”他们高声叫道，	2
61	You should be thinking about others.	8
62	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
63	巨人的花园总是冬天，北风、冰雹、霜和雪在树间肆意起舞。	0
64	有些人用大斧头劈开岩石；另一些人在沙滩匍匐前行。	8
65	星孩星孩吃过喝过后，老头儿走了出去，把身后的门锁上，并用铁链子把门拴得牢牢的。	3
66	贫穷从我们不见阳光的小巷溜进来，瞪着饥饿的眼睛；罪恶面无表情地接踵而来。	3
67	今天你去给我把那块白金拿来,要是你拿不来，那我准会让你挨上一百鞭子。	2
68	他立即进了门，把那孩子塞进她的怀里；她亲过孩子，把他放在他们家最小的孩子躺着的小床上。	0
69	那确实是一幕让人惊喜的景色。	0
70	奴隶们都趴在桨上睡着了。	8
71	It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.	0
72	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
73	他一时忘了自己的忧愁，返身跑到那儿，看见一只小兔子掉进了猎人设下的陷阱。	1
74	The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.	0
75	这一时期，许多有意思的故事都是讲述他的。	7
76	接着他又睡着了，做起梦来，梦境如下：	8
77	别为了你的快乐去捕捉它们。	8
78	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
79	How fortunate it is for the King's son, he remarked, "that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.	7
80	So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.	8
81	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
82	孩子们从大墙的一个小窟窿里钻进了花园，正坐在树的枝杈上。	8
83	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
84	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
85	And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, 'What robe is this that thou art weaving?'	3
86	A person of my position is never useful.	5
87	等他回到魔术师家时，魔术师给他打开门，让他进来，对他说：“你把那块黄金带来了吗？”	7
88	“他们是我的仆人。”她回答说。	4
89	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
90	两个樵夫向前走啊走啊，拼命往他们的手上哈气，并在雪块儿上使劲跺他们的粗铁钉大皮靴。	8
91	来和我一起玩儿吧，我不会取笑你的。”	4
92	三个阿拉伯人骑着野毛驴出来，向他们投掷标枪。	3
93	“可是你们的小伙伴哪里去了？”他问道，“就是我抱上树的那个小男孩儿。”	7
94	It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.	0
95	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
96	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，”她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂，	1
97	In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.	0
98	你能对买主说：'你要可劲儿买啊！'又对卖主说:'你要卖这个价钱？'我想不会吧。	8
99	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
100	Well, good-bye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you."	0
101	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
102	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
103	Come back! come back! screamed the Rocket, "I have a great deal to say to you"; but the Duck paid no attention to him.	8
104	他真心为他过去的行为感到后悔。	1
105	I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here."	7
106	三年中他就这样在世界上寻找，这世界既没人爱他，也没人怜悯他或对他慈悲,可是这个世界正是他春风得意时为自己创造的啊。	1
107	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
108	At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.	7
109	比他过去见过的任何东西都要美丽得多。	6
110	“我不明白为什么春天这么晚了还不来，”自私的巨人心下思忖，坐在窗前看着他那冰天雪地的花园，“但愿这气候变化变化才好。”	1
111	很快他又进入了梦乡，做了这样一个梦:	8
112	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
113	一块是白金，一块是黄金，第三块金子是红色的。	8
114	“我自己的花园就是我自己的花园，”巨人说，“谁都明白这个理儿，我以后不让任何人来玩儿，我自己想怎么玩儿都行。”	7
115	在一个岩洞深处，死亡和贪婪注视着人群，死亡说：“我累了；三分之一的人给我，让我走吧。“	3
116	山谷底上的稀泥里爬岀许多龙和长着鳞片的可怕东西，豺在沙滩上跑来跑去,不时用鼻孔在空气里闻嗅。	5
117	Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something."	8
118	I am not laughing.	8
119	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任又寸目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
120	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
121	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
122	看哪！阳光从彩色窗户照射进来，光束在他身上编织了一件绢袍，比那件为他快乐而编织的皇袍还精美；	6
123	为一个暴君干活儿固然苦，可是干活儿找不到主子更苦啊。	3
124	后来，潜水者最后一次从水中上来,他带上来的那颗珍珠比所有的霍尔木兹回的珍珠还漂亮，它像满月那样有模有样,比晨星还耀眼。	0
125	那块花绸布取下后，星孩知道自己在一个地牢里，那儿亮着一盏牛角灯。	3
126	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
127	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
128	He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.	0
129	这是一幕可爱的景色，只有花园的一隅还是冬天。	0
130	贪婪见了直打战，连忙往头上撒灰烬。	3
131	他于是揭开斗篷，让老婆看那熟睡的孩子。	8
132	“我什么也不会给你贪婪说着,把手藏进她衣服的褶子里了。	3
133	He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.	3
134	I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.	0
135	她捶打着她那不育的胸脯,大声哭叫起来。	2
136	事情是怎么回事就是怎么回事，眼下实在冷得要命嘛。”	8
137	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
138	He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.	5
139	王后对他说：“这是你曾救助过的你的亲生父亲。”	0
140	But where is your little companion? he said: "the boy I put into the tree."	7
141	He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.	7
142	他老婆开了门，看见她丈夫平安回到身边，便把两条胳膊缠在丈夫脖子上亲吻丈夫，接着从他背上取下那捆柴火，扫掉他靴子上的雪，要他进屋子里来。	0
143	到了第三天，他来到了森林里的另一边，下到平原去了。	8
144	那是第二天就要举行加冕典礼的那天夜晚，年轻的国王独自坐在他的美丽的宫室里。	0
145	死亡大笑，拿起一块黑石头，扔进了森林，一片野毒芹丛里走岀身着火焰长袍的热病。	5
146	“一个家有了铁石心肠，还能不总刮来冷风吗？”他问道。	5
147	于是他跑开钻进了树林，呼唤着他的母亲来到他身边，可是没有人回答。	8
148	你能阻止这些事情发生吗？你愿意和麻风病人同床共寝吗？愿意和乞丐同桌共餐吗？狮子会按你说的做吗？野猪会听从你的命令吗？造成人间苦难的他不比你更精明吗？	3
149	Conversation, indeed! said the Rocket.	8
150	Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.	8
151	黑人们耸了耸肩，把尸体扔下了船。	5
152	于是星孩跟着兔子去了，瞧！在一棵老橡树的裂缝里，他看见了他正在寻找的那块白金。	6
153	“为国王寻找红宝石啊。”站在他身后的一个人说。	8
154	空气又污浊又沉闷，墙壁湿气淋淋,淌着水流。	5
155	然而，最让他念念不忘的是他将在加冕典礼上用的东西：皇袍，金线织的皇袍、镶嵌红宝石的皇冠、珍珠裹身的权杖。	7
156	Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.	8
157	宫殿的门开了，神父们和城里的大臣纷纷跑来迎候他，在他面前阿谀奉承，说:“你就是我们一直久候的君主，我们国王的骄子啊。”	7
158	“我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
159	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
160	It is going to rain sticks; and she rushed into the water.	3
161	告诉我，你能看见我的母亲吗？”	7
162	帆船船长把绳梯从船侧扔下海去，把绳梯的另一头紧紧地拴在两根铁支柱子上。	4
163	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
164	星孩对他说：“我没有带来。”	1
165	Let the fireworks begin, said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.	7
166	这片树林从外面看去非常漂亮，好像到处都是欢唱的鸟儿，到处都是温馨的花朵，星孩满心高兴地走了进去。	0
167	“在战争中，”织工回答说，“强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
168	一天，巨人回来了。	8
169	He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.	0
170	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.	2
171	Romance is a thing of the past."	1
172	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
173	他还曾度过一个不眠之夜，观察月光下的恩底弥翁団的银塑像。	7
174	他站起来，再看他们，瞧！他们转眼间成了国王和王后了。	6
175	For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.	0
176	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.	5
177	他跑进家门，既惊奇又惊喜。	6
178	You were talking about yourself, replied the Roman Candle.	8
179	I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."	7
180	另有故事传说，有人看见他用温暖的嘴唇深吻一尊修石桥时在河床里发现的古代石雕像冰冷的额头;这石雕像被认为是哈德良團的俾泰尼亚人奴隶。	8
181	It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.	0
182	海盗在荒芜的海岸劫掠，把渔民的船烧掉，抢走他们的渔网。	3
183	I remember myself once--But it is no matter now. 	8
184	那位香客回答说：“看看这面镜子,你会看见他的。“	7
185	It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. 	7
186	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
187	“你好冷酷啊。	3
188	Why! 	6
189	Gold Stick is very complimentary.	8
190	他确实备受仰慕。	4
191	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
192	When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.	8
193	他们终于脱险，因此高兴得不知怎么才好，哈哈大笑起来，大地在他们看来像一朵银花，月亮则像一朵金花。	0
194	“真是怪事啊！”在铸造车间干活儿的工人监工说，	6
195	Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.	8
196	你不是我们当中的一员。	8
197	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
198	然而等他来到树林外围，他听见灌木丛里传来一声痛苦的尖叫。	3
199	他身后继位的人却以恶治国。	3
200	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
201	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
202	In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.	7
203	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
204	皇袍图案出自当今最负盛名的艺术家们之手，数月前他就躬身审查，下旨交给技工不分昼夜赶制出来,并在全世界收集和图案般配的珠宝。	8
205	They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.	2
206	The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. 	0
207	“所有的人都是这样的，”织工回答说，“年幼的是这样，年老的也是这样;女人是这样，男人也是这样；小孩儿们是这样，上了年纪的也是这样。	8
208	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你又寸待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
209	可是星孩说：“不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
210	The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none.	8
211	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
212	他急匆匆穿过草地，来到了那孩子身边。	7
213	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
214	“我在寻找我的母亲，”他回答说,“我求求你放我进去，也许她就在这城里呢。”	4
215	Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.	0
216	I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.	7
217	It certainly was a marvellous sight. 	0
218	他在所有事情上都左右着他们，他们都变得铁石心肠，和他完全一样。	5
219	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
220	I don't think much of that, said the Duck, "as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
221	奴隶们赤身裸体，只缠着一块破腰布,每个人都用铁链与相邻的人拴在一起。	3
222	But I like arguments, said the Rocket.	0
223	所以我一定要离开这里，走遍全世界也要找到她，直到得到她的原谅。”	7
224	星孩走出了城门，来到了魔术师告诉他的那片树林旁边。	8
225	船长见状哈哈大笑，伸岀手把那颗珍珠拿起来，端详过后，他把珍珠按在额头,鞠了一躬。	0
226	巨人对所有孩子都非常和蔼，可他仍一心想念他的第一个小朋友,经常说起他。	7
227	窗外，他可以望见大教堂那巨大的圆顶，朦朦胧胧的，宛如从影影绰绰的房屋上面鼓出的气泡，那无精打采的哨兵在河边薄雾笼罩的台地上来回走动。	8
228	你就快快离开这里吧，别再让我看见你这张难看的脸“	2
229	只有那个小男孩儿没有跑掉，因为他的眼睛里满是泪水，没有看见巨人走了过来。	1
230	After the banquet there was to be a Ball.	7
231	Whenever we appear we excite great attention.	0
232	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
233	他们在地上挖深坑，走了进去。	8
234	It was certainly a magnificent display.	0
235	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
236	最后他们到达一小海湾，开始测水深。	7
237	的确，这天夜里他躺在奢侈的御榻上，注视着壁炉里正在熊熊燃烧的大松木圆木，脑子里转悠的就是这个。	7
238	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, "but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
239	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
240	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
241	巨人悄悄地站在他身后，轻轻地把他拿在手里，放在了树上。	4
242	我这件皇袍是悲伤的织机织的，是痛苦的苍白的手织的。	1
243	樵夫和他老伴儿走岀家门，喊来星孩,对他说：“快到家里来，你这下找到你妈妈了，她正在等你呢。”	7
244	他身边的一块毯子上坐着帆船的船长。	8
245	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
246	Then one of them caught sight of him.	8
247	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
248	The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.	6
249	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说：“他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
250	他们伸开瘦巴巴的臂膊，在水里划着沉重的桨。	5
251	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
252	“不吻，”星孩说，“你的样子太脏,我能吻蛭蛇和癞蛤蟆都不会吻你。”	5
253	I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.	5
254	All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.	0
255	“这就是我的皇冠。”他回答说。	4
256	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."	2
257	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
258	花园里唯一感到高兴的人是雪和霜。	0
259	“他太自私了。”秋天说。	5
260	And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.	0
261	可是孩子们说他们并不知道他住在哪里，过去从来也没有见过他；巨人觉得伤心极了。	1
262	一天夜里，这城市飞来一只小燕子。 	8
263	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
264	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky."	0
265	他还很幼小,没法儿爬上树的枝杈，正围着那棵树转啊转啊，哭得伤心极了。	1
266	他对红雀儿说：“你能在高高的树梢上飞来飞去，能看见全世界。	7
267	可是我不会穿这件皇袍，也不会戴上这顶皇冠，就是我去宫殿，也是不戴皇冠就去的。	8
268	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
269	“啊呀，老公啊！”她嘟哝说，“难道我们自家的孩子还不够多，你非要捡一个弃儿往咱炉边挤吗？	2
270	可朝臣听完三个梦后彼此面面相觑,纷纷耳语说：“他一定是疯了，梦就是梦，幻觉就是幻觉，这哪儿是哪儿？	6
271	I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.	7
272	那根光秃秃的牧羊棍儿绽开了花朵儿，素雅的百合花比珍珠还洁白；	0
273	In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.	6
274	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
275	“富人和穷人难道不是兄弟吗？”年轻的国王问。	6
276	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
277	The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.	0
278	One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. 	8
279	I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.	7
280	国王说：“这就是你的母亲，你用泪水清洗了她的脚。”	0
281	他穿着漂亮的王服，站立在他们面前，风琴弹岀了乐曲，号手吹响了他们的号角，童子唱起了圣诗。	0
282	然而，他的美反使他不学好只学坏。	6
283	可以肯定的是，老国王弥留之际不知是追悔他的深重罪孽还是打心眼儿里希望他的王国能代代相传，命人去把这个小伙子找来，当着全体大臣的面，指定他是他的继位人。	7
284	“唔，在我看来嘛，”啄木鸟这个天生的哲学家说，“我对原子理论的种种解释可不感兴趣。	8
285	我不是你的儿子，用不着听你说三道四。”	2
286	You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow, said the Giant.	7
287	She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.	4
288	于是他悄悄走下楼梯，蹑手蹑脚地打开前门，走出房子，进了花园。	3
289	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
290	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
291	但是要饭的女人一言不发。	8
292	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
293	事实上一切珍奇贵重的东西都深深地迷住了他，他迫不及待想弄到手中，就派遣许多商人四面出击：有的和北边海域粗俗的渔民一起去收买琥珀；有的去埃及搜寻只有在国王陵墓才找得到的珍奇绿松石，据说这种东西具有不可思议的魔力;有的去波斯购置丝毯和彩绘陶器；另有一些人去印度置办彩色象牙、月长石、翡翠镯子、檀香、蓝珍琅和细羊毛披巾。	8
294	”他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
295	Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. 	0
296	年轻的国王拽过来一枝爬上阳台的野藤，折下来，做成一个圆圈，戴在了自己的头上。	0
297	他一次又一次浮上来，每一次上来他都带来一颗美丽的珍珠。	7
298	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
299	“我原来以为有些人生来就有帝王相呢，”他回答说，“不过也许你说的有道理。	7
300	The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. 	0
301	We don't know, answered the children; "he has gone away."	8
302	“你好冷酷，”她惊叫道，	3
303	他不管遇到什么都会打听打听，是不是看见了他的母亲。	7
304	What are fireworks like? she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.	7
305	老头儿用戒指打开门后，把星孩领到了大街上。	8
306	只有花园里的自私巨人还过着严冬的日子。	5
307	There was no doubt about it.	4
308	起码可以说这是个暗地里流传的故事。	8
309	但是他们不让进，还用他们的长矛刺他。	2
310	他看见一幕美不胜收的景致：	0
311	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
312	Well, well, said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, "everybody has different tastes.	8
313	樵夫回答说：“是的，是我在树林里找到他的，就是在十年前的今天。”	8
314	Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. 	6
315	So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.	8
316	但是他一弄明白是谁在等他后，冷嘲热讽地笑道:“得了，我母亲在哪里呢？我只看见这个脏臭的要饭女人呀。	5
317	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
318	What a pity!	1
319	好像从他被承认的那一刻起，他就对注定会对他的生活发生重大影响的美，显示出种种古怪的激情。	0
320	He must have a truly romantic nature, said the Catherine Wheel, "for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about"; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.	6
321	如果你不穿上国王的服装,那人们怎么才能知道你是一个国王呢？”	6
322	每天他都在城堡屋顶上劈劈啪啪下三个小时，把屋顶上大多数瓦片都打破了；随后他又在花园转呀转呀，忙不迭地奔啊跑啊。	1
323	他黑如乌木，他的裹头巾是红绸布。	8
324	你以为乌鸦会喂我吗？你对这些事情有什么良策？	7
325	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
326	年轻的国王大吃一惊，转过身来，看见一个人装扮得像香客，手里拿着一面银镜。	6
327	老人往他面前的一个木盘子里放了一些发霉的面包说：“吃吧，”又往一个杯子里倒了些稍带咸味的水，说：“喝吧”。	5
328	“别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	0
329	一些别的奴隶从船舷好奇地探视着。	6
330	And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, 'My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?'	6
331	What a delightful voice you have! cried the Frog.	0
332	He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.	8
333	它从天边一路往下落，途中路过了许多别的星星；他们惊奇地看着它下落，他们好像看见它落在离小羊圈不远一簇柳树后面了。	6
334	He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.	1
335	于是冰雹来了。	7
336	Well, after all there is nothing like mud.	8
337	但是那麻风病人苦苦哀求，星孩于是对他起了善心，把黄金送给他了。	4
338	BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same"; and he fell into the mud.	5
339	瞧你只是个叫花子，丑陋不堪，穿得破破烂烂。	5
340	多么可怕的灾难！	3
341	所以我才求你跟我走的,我为了找到你走遍了全世界。	7
342	有谁关心过咱们？	1
343	Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.	7
344	I never said that they had, replied the Rocket; "I said that they might.	7
345	星孩看看盾里的那个人，瞧瞧吧！他的脸完全像过去一样，他的英俊又回到了他身上，他还在他的眼睛里看到了他过去不曾见过的东西。	7
346	但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。	0
347	What a strange thing! said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.	6
348	因此，快让我们的君主戴上这顶皇冠，拿上这根权杖，以我们国王的公正和慈悲来统治我们吧。”	0
349	Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.	0
350	“是一个像我自己一样的人。	4
351	I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.	5
352	It is like the moon, and lives for ever.	7
353	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	4
354	They are like the Aurora Borealis, said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, "only much more natural.	8
355	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
356	每逢他走过村庄，村里的孩子们就取笑他，朝他扔石头，赶马车的人甚至不让他睡在马厩里，生怕他会把存放在里面的玉米弄霉了，他看上去太令人恶心了，连雇工都赶他走，没有人怜悯他。	5
357	Let us put it into the fire! said the other boy, "it will help to boil the kettle."	7
358	A horrible odour filled the place. 	5
359	过了一会儿，他从御座站起身，倚在烟囱的雕花斜墙上，四下打量着灯光暗淡的屋子。	8
360	他的同伴们追随他，因为他漂亮，腿脚快，能跳舞，会吹奏，写曲子。	0
361	死亡又大笑起来，用手指吹响口哨,一个女人从天而降。	0
362	What right have you to be happy?	8
363	It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.	0
364	他觉得他在一片昏暗的林子里闲荡,上挂满了奇怪的果子和美丽的毒花儿。	3
365	However, I don't care a bit.	8
366	 I shall never get over it."	1
367	Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean, said a Bengal Light; "I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister."	2
368	因此还是回你的宫殿去，把紫袍穿起来，把细亚麻穿起来。	0
369	他身上没有包着一件绣满星星的金丝斗篷吗？	8
370	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
371	第二天，他走进土牢对星孩皱起眉头，说：“在这邪教徒城门附近一个树林里，放着三块金子。	5
372	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
373	他们搂住他的脖子亲吻他，把他带进了宫殿,给他穿上漂亮的衣服，把皇冠戴上他的头，把权杖放入他手中，他于是统治了这个临河的城市，成为一城之主。	6
374	他把小伙子留在身边使唤,他用清水洗过澡后，打开了一个大油漆箱子，从中取出他的皮革腰衣和粗羊皮袍,那是他在山坡上放牧羊人的羊群时穿的衣服。	8
375	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
376	另一个士兵手里拿着一面黄旗，对他说：“谁是你母亲呢？你为什么寻找她？”	8
377	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
378	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
379	许多年过去了,巨人年纪很大很大了,身体衰老得不行。	1
380	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
381	Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.	0
382	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
383	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	0
384	一个人从人群里走岀来，恶狠狠地跟他说：“老爷，难道你不明白穷人的生活仰仗富人的奢侈吗？	2
385	可是守城的士兵把手里的矛枪往城门口一横,对他粗鲁地说：“你到城里有什么事？”	2
386	天气冷得岀奇，连动物和鸟儿都不知道怎样对付下去了。	3
387	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
388	A new arrival, I see! said the Frog.	6
389	After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. 	7
390	He is too selfish, she said.	5
391	Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."	0
392	Well, really, exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, "why not? It is a most joyful occasion.	0
393	”于是他把他做过的三个梦一一讲了出来。	8
394	他又抽泣起来，说：“母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
395	“跟我来吧。”兔子大声招呼说。随后穿过树林，来到一个水塘边。	4
396	我们种下玉米，我们的餐桌上却没有吃的。	1
397	但是她并没有消气，反而取笑他，越说气越大，最后哭泣道：“我们的孩子都没有面包吃，我们还养得起别人的孩子吗？	2
398	You are a very irritating person," said the Rocket, "and very illbred.	2
399	He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.	7
400	Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.	0
401	这个老头儿实际上是利比亚最眼疾手快的魔术师，他从一个在尼罗河古墓中栖身的大师那里获得了真传。	8
402	年轻的国王大叫一声醒来，瞧！他在他自己的寝宫里，透过窗户他看见一轮蜜黄色明月悬在暗淡的天空。	3
403	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
404	星孩回答他们说：“我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
405	I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun. 	7
406	I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.	5
407	She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.	0
408	And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	0
409	他们俩有一个比同伴跑得快，抢先从柳树中穿过去，从另一边跑岀来，瞧！白雪里真的有一样金玩意儿。	6
410	突然间，他惊讶得直揉眼睛，看了又看。	6
411	We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.	0
412	他们走到村边时，他的同伴对他说:“你得到了孩子，那就快把斗篷给我吧,曰:星孩既然是一起看见的，就应平分才对。	4
413	高兴起来吧。	0
414	他把一根尖芦苇刺进疆鼠模糊不清的眼睛，他们在一旁笑起来；他朝麻风病人扔石头，他们也笑个不停。	5
415	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
416	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶哪。”	1
417	年轻的国王走向一个织工，站在他身边打量他。	7
418	来呀，我们把她赶走,因为她好丑好难看哪。”	5
419	Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family."	0
420	“你说的是实话，”樵夫回答说，“可是我在树林里发现你时对你动了恻隐之心。”	4
421	Climb up! little boy, said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.	8
422	因为在这孩子的手掌上有两个指甲印子，他的小脚丫上也有两个指甲印子。	8
423	贪婪于是尖叫着在森林里飞奔，死亡跳上她的红马，疾驰而去，奔跑得比风儿还快。	7
424	So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.	6
425	百合花比精选的珍珠还白净啊，百合花的茎比银子还纏亮。	0
426	They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.	0
427	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
428	他发沉的眼睑垂了下来，一种少有的消沉一下子支配了他。	1
429	到处都是刺鼻难闻的气味。	5
430	一尊用青铜铸就的那喀索斯国雕像笑容满面，将一面打磨得亮提提的镜子举过头顶。	0
431	We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.	8
432	岸上吹来一阵轻风，甲板和大三角帆上落了一层细红的尘土。	8
433	How happy we are here! they cried to each other.	0
434	We will go to sleep now, they said, "and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled"; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.	7
435	难道你是我们老板派来监视我们的探子吗？	2
436	人们肃然起敬，纷纷跪了下来，宫廷大员们赶快把剑收进鞘里，俯首称臣，主教的脸顿时变得惨白，双手抖动不止。	3
437	“他们不会认你的，陛下。”宫廷大臣叫道。	8
438	一个样子凶恶的老头儿正好路过，大声吆喝说：“我出这个价买下他。”他把钱付清后，领着星孩进了城。	3
439	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:“我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
440	他跪在耶稣像前,神龛旁的大蜡烛燃烧得很亮，香烧起的缕缕青烟在穹盖形成薄薄的雾环。	6
441	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
442	神父们和大臣们纷纷跪下，对他说：“从前有人曾预言过，今天会有人来统治我们的。	7
443	I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.	1
444	How selfish I have been! he said; "now I know why the Spring would not come here.	5
445	But they have not lost their only son, said the Roman Candle; "no misfortune has happened to them at all."	6
446	The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.	4
447	一个女人罩着黄面纱,缓缓地跟在一峰骆驼后面，时不时回过身来张望那具死尸。	5
448	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
449	野猪在山谷里拱吃玉米的根，狐狸咬断山间的葡萄藤。	3
450	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
451	As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.	0
452	七年期间，他把想说的话都说了，因为他的谈话是有限的，于是他决意返回他自己的城堡来。	7
453	四壁都挂着代表“美神胜利”的悬垂物，	8
454	他从放这两样东西的柜子里取出斗篷和琥珀链子，拿给她看。	8
455	船头上坐着一个弄鲨人，不厌其烦地敲着一面鼓。	0
456	I was saying, continued the Rocket, "I was saying--What was I saying?"	7
457	他穿着一身灰色服装，他吐出的气跟冰差不多。	1
458	但是星孩听不进去他们的话，皱起眉头一副不屑一顾的样子，他跑回同伴中间,带领他们玩耍。	5
459	TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED	3
460	秋天给每一座花园带来了金色的果实,但是巨人的花园却得不到秋天的垂青。	1
461	等他来到魔术师的住宅，魔术师给他打开门，让他进来，对他说：“你把那块白金带来了吗？”	7
462	What is a sensitive person? said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.	8
463	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
464	小侍从见了吃了一惊，瞪起他那蓝蓝的大眼睛，微笑着跟他说：“陛下，我看你有皇袍和权杖，可你的皇冠在哪里呢？	6
465	我求你赶紧让人把他叫来吧，为了找到他我把全世界都走遍了。	7
466	And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.	0
467	Dear me! said the little Squib, "I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."	6
468	You must certainly see them."	7
469	但是孩子们一看见他，吓得胆战心惊，纷纷逃跑了,花园又变成了冬天。	3
470	一颗非常明亮而美丽的星星从天上掉下来了。	0
471	苦难在一大早就把我们弄醒，耻辱夜里和我们坐在一起。	1
472	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
473	梭子嗖地穿过经线时，他们就把沉重的箝座提上去；梭子停下时，他们放下箝座，把线紧紧压在一起。	8
474	Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."	5
475	“呜呜呜！”狼嗥叫着，两条后腿夹着尾巴慢吞吞地在灌木丛里穿行，“这真是冻死人的鬼天气。	2
476	巨人欣喜若狂地跑下楼梯，岀了房子冲进花园。	0
477	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
478	他身穿王服站在那里，上帝的荣耀无处不在，雕琢的壁龛里的圣徒们好像动弹起来了。	4
479	In every tree that he could see there was a little child.	8
480	“快让我看看，瞧瞧这家要什么没什么，我们需要的东西太多了。”	7
481	I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming, said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; "I hope there will be a change in the weather."	7
482	还不如冻死在树林里好呢，要么让什么野兽撞上咱们，吃了也行啊。	3
483	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
484	空气又污浊又沉闷，墙壁湿气淋淋,淌着水流。	5
485	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
486	太阳西下时，他坐在地上哭起来，可就在哭泣时，他从陷阱里救上来的小兔子来到了他的跟前。小兔子跟他说：“你哭什么？	1
487	他把他那棕色的髯发从额头往后梳理一下,拿起古琵琶，手指在弦上随意弹动。	0
488	In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.	4
489	He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.	0
490	人们在十二点钟去市场时，发现巨人在他们见过的最美丽的花园里和孩子们玩耍。	0
491	然后,他给老主教讲了他的三个梦。	8
492	这乐曲在他耳际萦绕，妙不可言，他原以为一定是国王的乐师演奏着曲子走过。	0
493	This is a delightful spot, he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." 	0
494	When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.	0
495	他觉得他站在一间又长又矮的顶楼间，周围一片丁丁当当的织机声。	8
496	跟我走吧,我的儿子，我需要你的爰哪。”	4
497	This is evidently a deputation, said the Rocket; "I will receive them with becoming dignity" so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.	8
498	In fact, I shall go so high that--	7
499	The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.	0
500	That is what is called sympathy.	4
501	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
502	What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.	0
503	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，“这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
504	May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?	6
505	What a curious shape you are!	6
506	那些跑掉的孩子，看出来巨人不再像过去那样坏，又都跑回来，春天也跟着孩子们来了。	0
507	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
508	The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.	0
509	There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.	5
510	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
511	他们以矛击盾操练过了,把铁盔戴在了头上。	8
512	请你给我爰吧。	4
513	My own garden is my own garden, said the Giant; "any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself."	8
514	“什么东西？”她大声问，	6
515	He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.	5
516	他们把我赶岀了城门，谁都不管我的死活。”	2
517	星孩走进了岩洞，在最远的那个死角他找到了那块红色金子。	7
518	它们不是世人应该在意的真东西。	8
519	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
520	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
521	Well, that is his loss, not mine, answered the Rocket.	8
522	埃及设防的城市里也流行饥荒，蝗虫是从大荒漠里出来的。	1
523	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
524	The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.	7
525	Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.	7
526	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
527	The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.	0
528	樵夫把她弄进自己家里，他老婆照料着她，等她从晕厥中醒过来，他们夫妇赶紧又给她吃又给她喝，让她安心呆着。	8
529	据说那个墓穴里还躺着一个人，死者是一个异常英俊美丽的青年，他的双手用绳子反绑着，胸部被捅了很多刀，衣服都被血染红了。	3
530	But the girl frowned.	5
531	快快离开这里，我们可受不了你和我们一起玩耍了。”他们一起把他赶出了花园。	5
532	I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.	4
533	我吃了很多苦才找到了你啊。”	1
534	“我有许多美丽的花儿，”他说，“可是孩子们才是所有花中最美丽的花朵啊。”	0
535	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
536	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	3
537	他于是走到水井旁，往下看去，瞧呀!他的脸果真像癞蛤蟆的脸，他的身上像蛭蛇一样长满了鳞片。	3
538	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
539	我要走遍天下去寻找她，不找到她决不罢休。”	7
540	“你在这幢房子里竟说出这样的话？”年轻的国王说，他大步走过主教,走上祭坛的台阶，站在耶稣像的前面。	6
541	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
542	他看见了什么呢?	7
543	You have talked the whole time yourself.	8
544	凡是陪他去留给他使用的那套房间的人，都经常提到他一看见为他准备的精美衣服和大量珠宝快活得脱口惊叫；提到他脱掉他那身粗糙的皮束，腰外衣和破旧的羊皮长袍时欣喜若狂的样子。	6
545	At last, however, the fire caught him.	8
546	死亡大笑起来，拿起一个杯子，放进一个水池里，疟疾就从杯子里站立起来。	8
547	“不死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
548	Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do."	5
549	老头儿从缠头布上取下一块花绸布，蒙在星孩的眼睛上，推操着往前面走。	3
550	The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.	0
551	印度一些设防的城市里流行饥荒，撤马尔罕的水塘耗干了。	1
552	那块黄金正在水塘的底上躺着呢。	6
553	他对所有的市民都主持公道，施与慈悲；他把那个邪恶的魔术师驱逐岀去，给那个樵夫和他老伴儿送去许多丰厚的礼物，并且对他们的孩子封官晋爵。	4
554	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, 'Why art thou watching me?	2
555	那女人没有理他,只是向炉火边靠近。	8
556	兔子跟他说：“你找的那块红金子就在你身后的那个岩洞里。	4
557	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
558	因为我不认自己的母亲,把她赶走，傲慢无礼，对她冷酷无情。	5
559	太阳落山时他只好朝家的方向走去，哭得伤心极了，因为他知道什么命运在等着他。	1
560	他回答说：“我母亲是一个要饭的,就和我一样，我很恶劣地对待过她，我求你让我进去，她也许会原谅我，要是她真的呆在这座城里的话。”	8
561	星孩一看她走了，心下欢喜，赶紧去找他可以一起玩耍的小伙伴去了。	0
562	你在这树林里找什么呢?”	6
563	Good-bye, cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.	0
564	但她不吃也不喝，只是对樵夫说:“你不是说这孩子是在树林里找到的吗?	6
565	It's quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, "as clear as crystal!" and the King doubled his salary a second time.	0
566	What a curious shape you are!	6
567	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, "I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
568	他一点儿也不可怜穷人，对瞎子、残疾人和有病有灾的人，一点儿也不知怜悯，反而朝他们扔石头，硬把他们往大路上赶，要他们到别的地方要饭吃。于是，除了不法之徒，别人不敢再到村里来讨吃讨喝。	5
569	“现在这是你们的花园了，小娃娃们，”巨人说他拿起了一把大斧头，把那堵墙砍倒了。	7
570	他们像蚂蚁一样集聚在岩岸边。	5
571	The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.	8
572	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。”	2
573	你和我们有什么关系？我们受苦与你有何相干？”	5
574	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
575	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
576	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
577	One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.	8
578	你是老几，竟敢给上帝的世界带来痛苦？	2
579	他一回来就看见孩子们在花园里玩耍。	0
580	I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out.	0
581	他们一脸饥饿相，瘦弱的手哆嗦个不停。	1
582	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name"; and he leaned down and plucked it.	4
583	“那就跟我来吧，”兔子说，“我带你去找到它，我知道它藏在哪里，也知道为什么藏在那里。	7
584	Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. 	0
585	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
586	那女人听了这些话，大叫一声，晕了过去。	6
587	“你当时在他身上发现什么标志没有？”她大声问道，	8
588	有一次他们陷进了深雪坑,挣脱出来就像正在磨面的磨工那样子白了；有一次他们滑进了池水结冰的光滑冰面上，他们的柴火摔散了捆，他们只好把柴火捡起来，重捆在一起；又有一次他们以为迷了路，心下害怕得要命，因为他们知道雪对任何睡在它们怀里的人都毫不留情。	3
589	It may be so with you, he answered; "indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.	8
590	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说：“这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
591	你母亲没有住在这个城里。”	1
592	他对疆鼠说：“你能钻到地下去。快告诉我，我母亲在那里吗？”	7
593	他到处寻找，却总找不到魔术师说的那块白金，找啊找啊，从早上找到中午，从中午找到夕阳西下。	1
594	所以,放我走吧，我一定要再一次走遍全世界,尽管你们给我拿来这皇冠和权杖,可我不能久留此地啊。”	7
595	这时候城门旁正坐着一个麻风病人。	8
596	“哎呀！我的儿，”她哭叫道，“我走之前你不吻我吗？	1
597	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
598	雪往草地盖上了她那巨大的白色斗篷，霜把所有的树都涂上了银色。	0
599	星孩回答说：“我在寻找一块藏在这里的黄金，我要是找不到它，我的主人会打我，把我当奴隶使唤的。”	1
600	主教听了他的三个梦，眉头皱起来,说：“我的孩子，我是一个老人，已是花甲暮年，大千世界里发生过的许多恶行,我见得多了。	5
601	樵夫这时在附近一个木料场里砍木头，看见了星孩的所作所为，就跑过来训斥他说：“你真是铁石心肠，一点不知可怜人，这个可怜的女人究竟干了什么坏事惹了你，你这样对待他？”	2
602	接着冰雹停止了在头顶砰砰乱跳，北风不再呼呼吼叫,一股扑鼻的香气从开着的窗扉飘到了他跟前。	0
603	她的衣服破破烂烂，因为在粗粝的路上行走脚磨得血淋淋的，样子非常狼狈。	5
604	“我们的老板！”织工恶狠狠地大声说，	2
605	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
606	He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.	8
607	他在幻觉中看见自己站立于大教堂高高的祭坛上，身穿华贵的龙袍，他那孩童般的嘴角露出顽皮而持久的微笑,他那黑髏黯林地般的眼睛放射岀明亮的光芒。	0
608	他过去从来没有如此急切地,或说如此狂喜地感受到诸多美丽的东西的魔力和真谛。	0
609	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
610	Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.	0
611	年轻的国王又低下他的头，祈祷，等完成他的祷告，他站了起来，转过身悲哀地看着他们。	1
612	Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.	6
613	瞧这冷风一个劲儿往屋里刮，我都冻死了。”	3
614	所以我对你所干的事情不赞成，劝你掉转马头回宫,让自己脸上高兴起来，穿上那套适合国王身份的衣服，戴上那顶我将为你加冕的皇冠，拿起那根我将交付你手的珍珠权杖。	4
615	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
616	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。	1
617	一天早上，巨人醒来躺在床上，这时他听见了一种美妙的乐曲。	0
618	那是十年前的今天吗？”	6
619	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
620	Hallo! cried one of the boys, "look at this old stick! I wonder how it came here"; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.	6
621	但是他们信任好心的圣马丁，他对所有的行人都悉心看护，因此他们认着别人的脚印往回走，走得精疲力竭，终于走到了森林的外围，看见在他们脚下的山谷远处，他们居住的村子灯光闪烁。	4
622	“别呀，”他大声说，笑起来，“我们何必不把这丑东西当奴隶卖了，他的身价还够一碗甜酒的钱吧。”	5
623	人群拥拥挤挤，到处都是，他迷了路，最后来到了一个大广场上，只见广场上有一座王宫。	7
624	街上突然传来一阵闹哄哄的喧嚣，那些宫廷大员来势汹汹闯了进来，他们手中的剑已出鞘，盾牌闪着金属的光泽，头上的冠羽摇来晃去。	3
625	他爱恋自己，夏天里微风不起水波不动时，他常常趴在神父果园的那口井旁，注视井下他自己那张脸的精妙之处，为从自己美貌中获得的愉悦而欢笑。	0
626	“要是你真的是我的生身母亲，”他说，“那你还是离去的好，别在这儿让我丢脸，你瞧我原以为我是某颗星星的孩子,而不是一个叫花子的孩子，像你和我说的那样。	2
627	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
628	They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.	0
629	I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion, said the Rocket; "no doubt that is what it means," and he looked more supercilious than ever.	5
630	然后他又邀请北风与他们做伴，北风就赶来了。	0
631	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
632	Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.	6
633	The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. 	2
634	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
635	老主教看见他身穿牧羊装进来，从教座上惊讶地站起来，赶过去迎住他，对他说：“孩子啊，这就是国王的行头吗？我用什么皇冠来给你加冕？我拿什么权杖递交你手中？今天一定是你的欢乐日，一定不该是你的屈辱日吧。”	6
636	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说：“快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
637	苍白的病恢恢的孩子们蜷缩在大梁上。	1
638	贪婪一看三分之一的人都死了，心痛得捶胸哭泣。	1
639	But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected."	1
640	他欣喜若狂，一把抓住它，对兔子说："我为你效了点儿劳，你却成倍地补偿了我；我对你发了点儿善，你还我的有百倍之多啊。”	0
641	第二天,这樵夫把那件少见的金斗篷放进一只大箱子里，他老婆又取下孩子脖子上戴的琥珀链子，也放到大箱子里去了。	8
642	他早先去拜访他的朋友、康沃尔的吃人魔去了，和吃人魔一呆就是七年。	3
643	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
644	And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. 	0
645	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
646	于是他赶紧跑过去，弯下腰用手去拿，原来是一件金丝织的斗篷，精巧地绣着许多星星，叠了许多折。	0
647	You certainly are! cried the Bengal Light.	6
648	A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes, answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
649	She was like a white rose before, said a young Page to his neighbour, "but she is like a red rose now"; and the whole Court was delighted.	0
650	Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.	0
651	“多么奇怪的现象，”鸟类学教授走过桥时说，	6
652	Boom! Boom! went the Roman Candle.	6
653	As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things."	8
654	“没事的，这可是一个星孩，他回答说；随后他给她讲了发现这孩子的奇怪经过。	8
655	It is one of my greatest pleasures.	0
656	我要把那个可怜的小男孩儿抱到那棵树顶上去，然后我再把这围墙拆掉，让我的花园世世代代成为孩子们的游戏场。”	7
657	鸟儿落在树上，唱起悦耳的歌儿，孩子们不由得停下游戏聆听鸟儿们歌唱。	0
658	其实只是一只小红雀儿在窗外唱歌，但是因为他很久没有听见鸟儿在他的花园里唱歌，所以他觉得这是人世间最美丽的音乐。	0
659	OLD Stick! said the Rocket, "impossible! GOLD Stick, that is what he said.	6
660	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
661	So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.	7
662	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
663	You had really better keep yourself dry, said the Fire-balloon.	4
664	一点不假，他真的是被猎人们非常偶然地发现的；当时他四肢裸露，手持笛子,跟在一群山羊后面；他是那个牧羊人一手拉扯大的，一直认为自己是牧羊人的儿子。	6
665	The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.	5
666	And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him.	0
667	一点不假，他有时会怀念起他在森林中无拘无束的生活，会又寸每天占去许多时间的宫廷繁礼缠节动辄大发脾气，但这令人入迷的宫殿--如人称所谓的“欢乐宫”------似乎是他寻欢觅乐的全新世界,他发现自己成了宫中的君王。	7
668	“我拿着三颗玉米粒，”她回答说,你问这干什么？”	6
669	“这颗明珠，”他说，“将镶嵌在年轻国王的权杖上。”他挥手示意黑人们起锚开船。	7
670	And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.	4
671	他看见星孩来了，赶紧敲响一个木碗，揺起他的铃，向他呼求，说：“给我一点儿钱吧，要不我就饿死了。	1
672	但是他的小伙伴一见他走来，纷纷嘲笑他说：“喂，你像癞蛤蟆一样肮脏，像蛭蛇一样可恶啰。	5
673	I have many beautiful flowers, he said; "but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."	0
674	There is no good talking to him, said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; "no good at all, for he has gone away."	6
675	但是谁都不敢看他的脸，只因他的脸像天使的圣容。	4
676	It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.	0
677	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
678	一个冬天的早上，他一边穿衣服一边看着窗外。	8
679	他觉得他躺在一艘大帆船的甲板上,一百名奴隶在挥桨划水。	7
680	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
681	谁是你的老板？〃年轻的国王问道。	7
682	宫廷大臣对年轻的国王说：“陛下,我恳求你把你这些不吉利的念头统统打消掉，快把这件漂亮的皇袍穿上，把这顶皇冠戴在头上吧。	7
683	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
684	Oh! dear no, cried the Rocket.	6
685	So the Hail came. 	8
686	他再也玩儿不动了，只好坐在他的大扶手椅子里，看孩子们玩儿游戏，观赏他自己的花园。	0
687	After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.	6
688	早上起来时，他从树上采摘了一些苦涩的浆果充饥，又向大森林出发，哭得伤心极了。	1
689	随后他用那块花绸巾蒙上星孩的眼睛，领着他穿过房子和罂粟花园,走上那五级铜台阶。	8
690	How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.	2
691	“你们在这里干什么？”他喊叫道,声音很霸道，孩子们赶紧跑散了。	2
692	我怎么能飞起来呢？	8
693	“不必多提，毕竟是你首先心疼我的呀。”兔子说，它转眼就跑走了。	4
694	过了一会儿，他们离开了屋子,他入睡了。	8
695	I believe the Spring has come at last, said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.	7
696	In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.	8
697	I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.	0
698	北风用皮外衣裹得严严实实，整天都在花园里呜呜叫个不停,把烟囱都刮倒了。	1
699	But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.	6
700	唯一欢迎这大冷天的好像只有大角猫头鹰。	0
701	他们来去匆匆，互相呼喊，没有人闲着。	8
702	“这位穿戴得像一个乞丐的国王在哪里------就是给我们王国带来耻辱的男孩儿？我们一定要杀了他,他根本不配统治我们。”	2
703	尼罗河没有泛滥，祭士们都在诅咒伊西斯回和奥西里斯図。	1
704	然而，他统治的时候不长，因为他过去遭受苦难太多，考验他的烈火太猛，他仅仅活了三年就死去了。	1
705	“你们一定告诉他务必明天来这里玩儿。”巨人说。	7
706	然而贪婪攥紧手，咬紧牙关。	4
707	我怎么能知道呢？”	8
708	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
709	When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.	0
710	鸟儿们到处飞动，高兴得叽叽喳喳鸣叫，花儿从绿草地往上张望，喜笑颜开。	0
711	咸涩的浪花在桨叶中翻飞。	1
712	Good heavens! cried the Goose.	6
713	And he certainly did explode.	6
714	树们非常高兴孩子们又回来了，便开满了花儿，在孩子们的头上轻轻地摇动起他们的枝杈。	0
715	Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?	7
716	但是正在他们互相哀叹他们的痛苦时，一件怪事发生了。	6
717	She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.	4
718	巨人看着这幕景致，心融化了。	1
719	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
720	他不准许任何人虐待鸟儿和野兽，而是教人懂得爱、亲情和仁慈；他向穷人发放面包，向衣不蔽体的人发放衣服，在他的国土上，到处一片祥和富足的景象。	4
721	两只苍鹭在船周围飞来飞去。	3
722	Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.	6
723	他高兴得大叫起来，跑了过去，跪下来亲吻他母亲脚上的伤口，眼泪都把伤口打湿了。	0
724	What a curious thing! he cried; "there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.	6
725	宫廷大臣和朝廷高官纷纷来向他跪拜称臣，侍从们给他送上金丝袍，把皇冠和权杖摆在他面前。	7
726	I am laughing because I am happy, replied the Cracker.	0
727	大银耳环垂在他那厚厚的耳垂上，每只手里拿着一只银白色的天平。	0
728	但他的心情却十分沉重，因为他知道什么厄运在等着他。	1
729	”他把所有朝臣都打发走，就留下一个留在身边作伴儿的侍从，一个比他还小一岁的小伙子。	8
730	星孩拿上那块黄金，把黄金装进了袋子，急匆匆往城里赶去。	7
731	你们怎么能说我生得美丽呢？	6
732	Delightful! he cried, "I shall go on like this for ever. 	0
733	星孩把他们领到哪里，他们就跟到哪里，星孩叫他们干什么，他们就干什么。	7
734	小男孩儿对巨人微笑着跟他说：“你曾经让我在你的花园里玩耍过，今天你跟我到我的花园去吧，那是天堂。”	0
735	我们整天为他们卖苦力，他们在金库里堆砌金子，我们的孩子们过早夭折了，我们热爰的那些人的脸变得冷酷而邪恶。	2
736	I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.	5
737	“我身穿痛苦铸就的衣冠，能高兴起来吗？”年轻的国王说。	1
738	However, I excuse your ignorance.	4
739	红雀儿回答说：“你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
740	The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.	1
741	但是，天哪！斗篷里面没有金子，也没有银子，当然也没有什么宝贝，只有一个小孩儿睡在里面。	6
742	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
743	一抹淡淡的茉莉花香从敞开的窗子飘了进来。	0
744	桌子上放着一只扁平的紫晶盒。	8
745	死亡对她说：“你手里拿着什么？”	8
746	但是那个巨人深爱的小男孩儿再也没有露面。	1
747	 “我什么都不会送给你的。”贪婪说。	1
748	人们笑起来，说：“刚刚骑马过去的是国王的弄臣吗？”他们取笑他。	6
749	她走得疲惫不堪，就在一棵栗子树下坐下来休息。	1
750	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
751	I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.	8
752	”他气得满脸通红，对他们说：“我就是国王。”他把他们的矛戟挡到一边，闯了进去。	2
753	然而星孩呆在原地一动不动，对她完全关上了心扉，除了那女人痛苦的哭泣声外，别的什么也没听到。	1
754	那个老神父也经常找他去，尽心尽力教他热爱有生命的东西，并对他说：“蝇子是你的兄弟。	4
755	他疲乏地爬下绳梯，消失在海中。	1
756	As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: "Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!" he said.	6
757	“大地就要喜结良缘了，这是她的婚礼服。”斑鸠彼此小声交谈说。	0
758	Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are! said the Duck; "and that reminds me how hungry I feel": and she swam away down the stream, saying, "Quack, quack, quack."	0
759	每天下午，孩子们从学校出来后，都往往到巨人的花园去玩耍。	0
760	那麻风病人也把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。”	7
761	The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.	0
762	He saw a most wonderful sight. 	6
763	他把红金子装进他的袋子，急忙朝城里赶去。	7
764	The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.	0
765	到处都是刺鼻难闻的气味。	5
766	星孩一听这话泪流满面，心下嘀咕道:“他们在嘲笑我，拿我的痛苦寻开心。”	1
767	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
768	一点儿不假，他对美崇拜有加，对弱者和生病的人一概嘲弄,极尽挖苦之能事。	5
769	这时樵夫的小女儿走到他身边，把手搭在他肩上，说：“即使你真的失去了你的美貌，那又有什么关系呢？	4
770	You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."	7
771	那女人就回答他：“我是你的母亲呀。”	4
772	“不！ ”孩子回答说，“这是爱的伤痕呀。”	4
773	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	6
774	我要到水井旁照一照去，井水会照出我的美丽。”	0
775	And when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.	7
776	当然,我们之间是有区别的------他穿金戴银而我衣衫褴褛，我饿得要死而他撑得难受。	1
777	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
778	Why, you don't even know him, growled the Roman Candle.	5
779	What did he see?	6
780	Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.	6
781	小松鼠在杉树上过着孤单的生活，他对小松鼠说：“我的母亲在哪里呢？”	1
782	He was really very sorry for what he had done.	1
783	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	1
784	年轻的国王打量着他。	7
785	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？”	2
786	放学后，他们只好绕着那圈高墙转悠，谈论着墙里那美丽的花园。	1
787	In fact, it is essentially suburban.	5
788	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
789	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
790	Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.	6
791	She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.	8
792	每长一岁，他就变得更美丽一些，村子里的人都感到好生纳闷儿,因为他们都生得黑皮肤黑头发，偏偏他长得又白又细嫩，像加工过的象牙一样，他满头髻发则像黄水仙的花环。	6
793	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
794	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
795	Just look at those yellow tulips.	6
796	年轻的国王听了这番话，不由大叫一声，从梦中醒来；他透过窗户看见黎明那长长的灰指头，紧紧抓着隐去的星星。	6
797	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
798	I had thoughts of entering public life once myself, remarked the Duck; "there are so many things that need reforming.	4
799	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
800	然而他根本不理睬他们，一路前行，走下明亮的斑岩楼梯，穿过一道道铜门，翻身上马，直奔大教堂而去，小侍从在他身后紧追不舍。	8
801	Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.	0
802	他勒住缰绳，说：“不，我就是国王。”	4
803	You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride."	0
804	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	0
805	每天下午，学校放学后孩子们都要来和巨人玩耍。	0
806	Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. 	1
807	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
808	星孩又进了树林，搜寻了一天那块红金子，但到处找也找不到。	7
809	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
810	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
811	Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.	0
812	他抽搐了一阵儿，接着就一动不动了。	3
813	请你现在认了你的孩子吧。”	7
814	The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.	1
815	钟楼响起午夜钟声时，他按响了铃,他的侍从进来毕恭毕敬地给他宽衣解带,给他倒上玫瑰水洗手，往他的枕头上撤了花瓣儿。	8
816	但是他对老婆说：“我在树林里拾到一样东西，就给你带来了，让你照管他站在门边没有进来。	7
817	可是士兵们嘲笑他，其中一个甩着黑胡子，放下手里的盾，大声说：“说真的，你的母亲见了你也不会感到快乐，因为你这副样子比沼泽地的癞蛤蟆还令人恶心，比水草地里乱爬的蛭蛇还令人害怕。	5
818	红玫瑰比红宝石还鲜红啊，玫瑰的叶子就是年殳扁的金子。	0
819	“我一直表现得多么自私啊！"他说，现在我明白了为什么舂天不到这里来了。	5
820	他变得越来越骄傲、残忍和自私。樵夫的孩子也好，村里别人家的孩子也罢，他一概不放在眼里，说他们都是低贱的父母生养的，只有他高贵无比，是从一颗星那里蹦出来的，他在孩子们中间称王称霸，把他们称为他的仆人。	5
821	Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.	5
822	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
823	那棵树马上鲜花怒放，鸟儿们纷纷飞来在上面唱歌，小男孩儿伸开他的双臂，紧紧抱住了巨人的脖子，亲吻他。	0
824	这时那要饭女人把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。“	7
825	但是那麻风病人一言不发。	1
826	他把它们穿在身上，手里还拿上了他那根粗糙的牧羊棍儿。	8
827	树间到处是猿和孔雀。	0
828	And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'	0
829	“真的就像哇哇地叫唤，哇哇叫唤当然是世上最有音乐感的声音了。	0
830	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，“不过这也不出我所料。	2
831	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.	1
832	“我想我不会喜欢小男孩儿，”燕子回答说，	8
833	Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.	5
834	实际上我发现这地儿相当单调乏味。	8
835	苍白的月儿听见了，把黎明忘在脑后，滞留在天空不肯离去。	0
836	“我觉得好凉快，”男孩子说，“我一定好多了。”他很快进入了香甜的梦乡。	0
837	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
838	王子和公主从此再没有幸福可言，他们的婚姻生活全都蒙上了阴影,至于国王，我知道他简直过不了这关。	1
839	'Buy back your wheelbarrow?	8
840	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
841	Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.'	8
842	我的臣子都叫我“快乐王子”，而且我也的确很幸福，如果开心就是幸福的话。	0
843	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
844	快啄一颗出来给他送去吧。	4
845	小燕子开始想事，很快就入睡了。	8
846	他脖子上挂着一条链子，上面坠着一块浅绿色宝石，他的手干枯得像黄枯的树叶。	8
847	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
848	And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.	8
849	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?'	8
850	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
851	So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.	1
852	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
853	And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.	0
854	“她像一朵白玫瑰！”他们呼叫着，纷纷从阳台上往她身上抛花儿。	0
855	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
856	I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.	8
857	Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
858	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
859	这样，在国王花园的一端搭起了一个大架子，皇家焰火匠将一切安排停当后,焰火们马上交谈起来。	7
860	And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.	0
861	他可以把蓝宝石卖给珠宝商，买回些食物和柴火，把他的剧本写完了。”	0
862	“回来！快回来！”火箭尖声叫道,“我还有许多话要跟你说呢。”但是鸭子没有理睬他。	0
863	他的头发像风信子花一样乌黑，他的嘴唇像他渴求的玫瑰一样殷红,可是激情使他的脸色白如象牙,忧愁使他的额头紧锁。” 	1
864	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，她就会和我一直跳到天亮。	0
865	The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain–Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice–King had kissed her.	6
866	像我这种身份的人从来都不是实用型的。	5
867	And the Star–Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
868	Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.	8
869	“我是来和你告别的。”他大声说。	1
870	不用说，他的做派显得特别高雅。	7
871	And what would you do in return? said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	7
872	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
873	No, answered the Linnet, "I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.	0
874	'Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'	6
875	“他像风向标一样美丽，”一位市议员发表看法说，一心想附庸风雅，“只是不怎么有用处啊。”他找补一句说，生怕人们会认为他不讲究实 际，因为他的确是一个务实的人。	5
876	'Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,' they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.	7
877	But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
878	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
879	只有真心相爱的情侣才能用这样的水晶杯喝酒，因为虚假的嘴唇一旦触及它，它便会变得灰暗无光，混浊不清。	6
880	他飞过河的上空，看见灯笼挂在船的桅杆上。	8
881	随后他看见了那根高高的柱子上的塑像。	6
882	She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.	7
883	“你愿意和我走吗？”他最后和她说,可是芦苇摇了摇头，她恋家恋得难以割舍啊。	7
884	Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding, and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again, and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.	3
885	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
886	她最初唱的是爱情在少男和少女的心扉萌生。	0
887	这是一场洋洋大观的婚礼，在一顶缀满珍珠的紫色天鹅绒华盖下，新娘和新郎手拉手缓缓走过。	0
888	我自己记得有一次------不过现在想想也没有什么。	1
889	她看见时便飞了过去，落在一根小花枝上。	7
890	雪橇的样子像一只金色大天鹅，这位纤巧的公主本人坐在天鹅的翅膀中间。	0
891	“大冬天还有燕子！ ”	6
892	“哦！可我们见过，在梦里见过。”孩子们回答说,刻板的校长把眉头皱起来, 一脸的严肃，因为他很不赞成孩子做梦。	0
893	“星星有多美啊，”他对她说，“爱情的力量又是多么美妙啊！ ”	0
894	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
895	Was he very distinguished? asked the Water-rat.	7
896	He said to the Linnet, 'Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst see the whole world.	7
897	“我担心它和我的衣服不配，”她答道，“再说，宫廷大臣的侄子送给我一些真珠宝，谁都知道珠宝要比花草贵重得多呀。”	5
898	And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.	4
899	But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.	1
900	他告诉王子尼罗河岸边站立的一排朱鹭,他们用大长嘴逮鱼吃,他告诉王子像这个世界一样古老的斯芬克生活在大沙漠里，天下的事情无所不知,他告诉王子牵着骆驼慢悠悠行走的商人，手里拿着一串串琥珀珠子,他告诉王子月亮山的国王,皮肤黑得像乌木，对一块大水晶石顶礼膜拜,他告诉王子在棕欄树上睡觉的大绿蛇,二十个僧侣用蜂蜜饼喂它,他告诉王子乘着大扁叶子在大湖上泛舟戏耍的小仙人,动不动就跟蝴蝶打仗。	7
901	“我早知道我会制造一起特大轰动的。”火箭喘着气说，然后熄灭了。	7
902	But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
903	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
904	我要去寻找我的女儿去了。	7
905	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: 'Wilt thou not close the door?	3
906	'And what signs didst thou find with him?' she cried.	7
907	除了非凡的火箭，每一个都表演得非常成功。	0
908	Thy mother dwells not in this city.'	1
909	“现在我要飞走了！”他嚷道，把身体绷得紧紧的，直直的，	7
910	他们的眼睛都像绿宝石，他们的吼叫声比大瀑布的呼啸还响亮呢。	0
911	只要我们一岀场,我们就会引起人们的极大注意。	8
912	不过，也得承认，她的声音有时听上去很美。	0
913	他落在一只大船的桅杆上，看着水手们用绳子从货舱往外拽大箱子。	6
914	然后他飞回来，跟王子讲了他的见闻。	7
915	But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her", and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.	1
916	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
917	“这里可不怎么舒服，”他说，“不过这里肯定是个时髦的水疗场，他们送我来休养身体的。	1
918	中午时，黄色的狮子纷纷到河边来饮水。	8
919	接下来的三天，大家都在传着一句话:白玫瑰，红玫瑰,红玫瑰，白玫瑰。”国王下了圣旨，这个侍童的俸禄增加一倍。	7
920	Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.'	8
921	“你的声音可真好听！”青蛙大声说，	0
922	“那你真应该去教授哲学，“蜻蜓说，他展开一对活泼可爱的纱一样的翅膀,飞向天空。	6
923	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	0
924	“我现在要爆破了，”他嚷道，	3
925	One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.	6
926	Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.	0
927	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
928	栖息在这绿色的林子里,看着太阳乘坐他的金马军，看着月亮乘坐她的银马车，真是一件开心的事啊。	0
929	“我很高兴你终于要去埃及了，小燕子，”王子说，“你在这里呆得够长了,不过你一定要亲亲我的嘴唇，因为我爱你呀。”	0
930	Tell me, canst thou see my mother?'	3
931	'I am seeking for my mother,' he answered, 'and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.'	7
932	他的所有穷亲戚他都从来不屑一顾,嗤之以鼻，这时却纷纷冲上天际，在一片片火光中像美妙的金花儿。	0
933	我对你别无所求，只求你做一个痴心情郎，因为爱情远比哲学更智慧------虽然哲学就够智慧了,比权力更强大---虽然权力就够强大了。	4
934	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。”	3
935	“她说过，如果我给她带红玫瑰来，她就和我跳舞。”年轻的大学生嚷嚷说,“可是我的花园里哪儿也没有红玫瑰啊。”	0
936	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
937	“瞧，快瞧！”玫瑰树招呼说，“这朵玫瑰终于培育成了。”但是夜莺没有回答，因为她躺在深草丛中，死了，心上带着那根刺儿。	0
938	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
939	Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.	5
940	Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has, and she got up from her chair and went into the house.	5
941	Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.	0
942	“去年夏天，我在河边呆着时,两个野男孩儿，就是磨坊主的儿子，总是用石头砸我。	3
943	炉膛没有火，他饿得有气无力。”	1
944	“国王的花园算不上世界,你这傻爆筒，”一个大焰火筒说，“世界是一个大得不能再大的地方，你花上三天时间把它看遍就不错了。	2
945	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
946	“我不会仅仅由于他不注意听就不跟他说话。	7
947	可怜的小燕子冻得越来越厉害，可是他不忍心离开王子，他爰他爰得刻骨铭心。	8
948	我顶不喜欢粗鲁无礼，凡是坏的行为举止我都讨厌，因为我这人特别敏感。	8
949	既然你有了机会，你就要充分利用，因为我过不了多一会儿就要回宫中了。	7
950	The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.	0
951	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
952	“那你还是不哭的好。”	4
953	燕子自己思忖道，“他可真是彬彬有礼，连说说个人意见都细声软语的。”	4
954	The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.	1
955	So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.	8
956	'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'	4
957	他一想事就要睡觉。	8
958	真的，事先要，非凡的火箭是早有安排，那到头来对他倒不见得有多好,不过王孙公子总是吉星高照啊！”	7
959	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
960	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
961	不一会儿，月亮升起来了，宛如美丽的银盾,星星一片灿烂，宫里传岀了悦耳的音乐。	7
962	How should I know?'	5
963	“有人在埃及等我，燕子说，	7
964	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of white gold?'	7
965	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
966	But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.	4
967	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
968	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
969	阁楼屋顶有窟窿，	8
970	他们不久就要到那个了不起的国王的墓里去睡觉。	7
971	For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.	1
972	“我从来没有说过我认识他呀，”火箭回答说，	6
973	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
974	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
975	“我可以爱你吗？”燕子问道，他喜欢单刀直入，有话直说。芦苇听了深深点了一下头。	7
976	他飞过白色的大理石上刻满天使的大教堂塔楼,	8
977	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
978	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
979	这里既没、非凡的火箭有社交活动，又没有安静去处。	8
980	And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.	5
981	它们是用珍贵的蓝宝石做的，是一千年前从印度买来的蓝宝石呢。	6
982	“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, "every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."	4
983	Do it no harm.	4
984	于是，他回到他的屋子，抽出一本积了灰尘的大厚书，开始读起来。	7
985	Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.	1
986	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
987	突然，一声尖厉的干咳声传来，他们纷纷四下张望。	6
988	“他的脚边还有一只死鸟！”市长继续说，	6
989	我可是宫廷的大宠儿,实际上，王子和公主昨天就是冲我的面子才举行婚礼的。	0
990	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
991	If you want a red rose, said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.	5
992	And what dost thou seek in the wood?'	8
993	我跟他们谈论漂亮的新娘时，你们会看见他们在不停地眨眼睛。”	7
994	“我们当然还得另铸一尊塑像，”他说，“那应该是我自己的塑像。”	6
995	可是我的花园里没有红玫瑰,那我只好孤零零坐在那里，眼睁睁看她从我身边走过去。	1
996	But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.	1
997	我们只好把它扔掉了。”	1
998	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
999	哑'和'大'听声音倒是挺像的它们往往也就是一回事吧。”他掉进了泥水里。	7
1000	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
1001	'Well, for my own part,' said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, 'I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.	4
1002	Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.	1
1003	但是，它们好像并没有发生多大作用。	1
1004	So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.	6
1005	Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar–woman.	7
1006	他也算是一个政治家了，在地方选举中还总能居领先地位，因此对议会的一套行话了如指掌。	4
1007	“你的画像很美丽他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。	0
1008	And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.	0
1009	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	7
1010	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have it not.'	8
1011	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
1012	For I have suffered much to find thee.'	7
1013	你今天晚上会听见我们合唱俱乐部的演唱。	7
1014	“什么是敏感的人？”爆竹问焰火筒说。	6
1015	你当然不知道这些事情了，活该你是一个乡下佬儿啊。”	5
1016	In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.	7
1017	'Do you really think I shall?' asked little Hans.	0
1018	实际上是你应该多想想我。	4
1019	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
1020	我就总是想到我自己，而且指望别人也都这么做。	8
1021	“在远处，”塑像接着低声软语地说，	8
1022	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
1023	“她刚才还像一朵白玫瑰，”小侍童对身边的人说，“可是她现在一下子成了一朵红玫瑰了。”整个宫廷听了都很高兴。	0
1024	他写了一封长信寄给当地报纸，谈及这件怪事。	8
1025	那个孩子渴坏了，可他的母亲干着急没办法啊。”	1
1026	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
1027	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
1028	“我要去'死神殿'了。	3
1029	“快去那个城市把那两件最珍贵的东西给我捡来。”上帝对他的一个天使说,天使给他拣来了那颗铅心和那只死鸟。	7
1030	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
1031	“音乐家们会在他们的乐池里就座，”年轻的大学生说，“弹奏他们的乐器，我的情人儿会随着竖琴和小提琴的乐曲翩翩起舞。她会跳得脚下生风，连地都不沾，那些献殷勤的人穿戴得漂漂亮亮,纷纷围着她打转转。	0
1032	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
1033	身姿优雅，高高的白色百合纷纷从窗户往里窥视，观看他们跳舞,而硕大的红芙蓉摇头晃脑，打着节拍。	6
1034	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
1035	燕子很容易就进去了。	8
1036	'Little Hans, Doctor.'	6
1037	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“在这城市的远处，我看见一个年轻人住在阁子间。	6
1038	这时有---个人偶然瞧见了他。	6
1039	Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.	6
1040	实际上，我要高高地飞到------”	7
1041	“为什么呢？真是的。”一只在一束阳光下飞舞的蝴蝶附和说。	6
1042	“好开心！”他嚷道，“我就要这样一直飞上去了。	0
1043	So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
1044	Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar–woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.	1
1045	Is that the end of the story? asked the Water-rat.	6
1046	And he said to her, 'Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.	1
1047	And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.	0
1048	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
1049	于是，燕子啄起王子剑柄上的那颗大红宝石，用嘴衔着飞过了城市屋顶的上空。	6
1050	大小报纸纷纷极尽溢美之词，赞扬他表演得淋漓尽致。	4
1051	But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
1052	Look, look! cried the Tree, "the rose is finished now", but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.	7
1053	小孩儿在发烧，口口声声要橘子吃。	1
1054	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
1055	原来是捆绑在长棍子端头的目无一切的大火箭在咳嗽。	3
1056	你肯定会看见它们的。”	7
1057	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
1058	What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good."	5
1059	“你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
1060	'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire, 'very thoughtful indeed.	0
1061	I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.	4
1062	月亮升上天空时，他飞回到快乐王子身边。	0
1063	明月升到天空时，夜莺飞到了那棵玫瑰树上，把胸膛顶在了刺儿上。	6
1064	“我这下住进黄金屋了。”他四下打量一番，悄悄跟自己说，然后准备睡觉,可是他正要把脑袋伸进翅膀下时，一大滴水落在了他的身上。	0
1065	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
1066	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
1067	周围变得鸦雀无声时，火箭又咳嗽一声，开口讲话了。	6
1068	“她不懂得跟人说话，”他说，“我担心她就是一个轻佻女子，看她风一来就摇晃的轻浮样儿。"	5
1069	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
1070	然而没有人看见他。	1
1071	她把火柴掉进臭水沟里，火柴都弄坏了。	1
1072	Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine–forest.	7
1073	我喜欢听我自己说话。	0
1074	我就不喜欢那些对着洒了一地牛奶哭嚎的人。	5
1075	And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.	0
1076	他身边有六名助手，每个助手用一根长竿子举着一支点燃的火炬。	6
1077	不管怎样，我都希望你在这里定居下来。”	7
1078	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
1079	小燕子于是围着芦苇飞啊，飞啊，用翅膀轻轻触动水面，激起一圈圈银色的涟漪。	0
1080	回响带着这绝唱萦绕在山间的紫色洞穴,惊醒了梦中的牧羊人,	6
1081	可在埃及，太阳把绿色的棕桐树照得热乎乎的，鳄鱼躲在泥里懒洋洋地打量棕梱树。	7
1082	She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.	7
1083	At present you have only the practice of friendship, some day you will have the theory also.'	6
1084	这是我的一大乐趣。	0
1085	那朵红玫瑰听见了，狂喜得直哆嗦，向清冷的晨气绽开了花瓣儿。	0
1086	“我不是要到埃及去，”燕子说，	1
1087	“我和你再呆一个夜晚吧，”燕子说，真的动了恻隐之心，	4
1088	他还没有张开翅膀，第三滴水又掉了下来，他抬头一看，只见——唔！天哪, 他看见了什么？	6
1089	燕子于是啄下来一片又一片赤金，把快乐王子啄得寸金不留,一副灰不溜丢的样子。	8
1090	In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.	0
1091	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
1092	Get thee gone.	2
1093	燕子啊，燕子啊，小燕子啊，你能把我剑柄端上的红宝石衔上送给她吗？	0
1094	Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.	0
1095	But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, 'Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.'	1
1096	“你当然难受了！”信号焰火叫道,	1
1097	“你原来一直在跟我调情啊。”他大声说，	6
1098	Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?'	7
1099	“我愿意再和你呆一个夜晚，”燕子说，“可是我不忍心啄掉你的眼睛。	4
1100	“这世界的确非常美丽，一个小爆筒大声说，	0
1101	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜 悯之情。	4
1102	And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.	0
1103	我们都有几手专长，这就够吃遍天下了。	0
1104	And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.	1
1105	然后是盛大的国宴，持续了五个小时。	0
1106	Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
1107	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
1108	It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet, and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.	6
1109	“你怎么一点儿都不像快乐王子 呢？” 一位明白事理的母亲对着自己无理哭闹的小孩儿说，	4
1110	“你有什么话捎往埃及吗？”他大声说，“我马上要飞走了。”	7
1111	'Lots of people act well,' answered the Miller, 'but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also', and he	0
1112	I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day', and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.	0
1113	And the Star–Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar–woman.	7
1114	那个年轻人两手把头抱得紧紧的,一点没有听见燕子扑棱翅膀的声音，他抬头看时才发现那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在那些枯萎的紫罗兰上面。	0
1115	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
1116	“我根本不这样看，”鸭子说，“我看这对别人一点用处也没有。	5
1117	“如果你想要一朵红玫瑰，”玫瑰树说，“你必须在月光下用音乐来孕育一朵啊，还必须用你自己的心血来染红它。	4
1118	The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company.	7
1119	And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.	6
1120	国王吹笛子吹得很差劲，可是谁也不敢跟他说明这点，因为他是一国之君呀。	4
1121	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”他干咳着，大家于是支起耳朵，只有转轮焰火仍在摇头叹息,小声念叨说：“浪漫这东西死了。	1
1122	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道,	2
1123	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
1124	王子有一双朦胧的紫罗兰色眼睛，头发像纯金般金黄。	4
1125	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
1126	芦苇一贯喜欢下雨, 可那完全是为了她自己。”	0
1127	It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.	5
1128	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
1129	我们都坐在那农夫住宅旁的老鸭水塘里，月亮一上来我们就开始合唱。	0
1130	And when he saw the Star–Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, 'Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.	7
1131	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。”	3
1132	于是，燕子啄掉了王子的另一只眼睛,衔着飞走了。	1
1133	“呱呱呱，呱呱呱，呱呱呱，”她说，	7
1134	你没有眼睛什么都看不见啊。”	4
1135	Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.	6
1136	Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.	7
1137	And the woman answered him, 'I am thy mother.'	0
1138	But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.	6
1139	“你说过，如果我给你帯一朵红玫瑰来，你会陪我跳舞，”大学生喊道，	7
1140	That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.	4
1141	You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.	4
1142	Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! he cried, "here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.	7
1143	The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.	5
1144	And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'	1
1145	瞧瞧你们还笑，找快活，仿佛王子和公主根本没有结婚似的。	7
1146	'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.	1
1147	浪漫这东西是老皇历了。”	6
1148	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
1149	And the Star–Child frowned and said to himself, 'What is this that they say to me?	6
1150	这样省时间，免得引起争论。”	0
1151	“我自己也曾经想介入公共生活，”鸭子说，“需要改革的事情多不胜举。	0
1152	“他一定天生就具有真正的浪漫气质，”转轮焰火说，“因为这时候就根本没有他流泪的理由呀她深深叹息了一声，又寻思那个松木盒子。	0
1153	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
1154	His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.	0
1155	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
1156	多么遗憾啊！”	1
1157	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	4
1158	He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'	8
1159	And the Hare said to him, 'The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.	6
1160	“我身上裹着赤金王子说，“你一定把它啄下来，一片一片地啄，把它送给穷人,活着的人总是以为金子能让他幸福。”	0
1161	“我承认她是个固守闺房，”燕子继续说，“可我喜爱到处走走，夫唱妇随，我的妻子也应该喜爱到处旅游才是。”	5
1162	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.'	3
1163	For I see none here but this vile beggar–woman.'	1
1164	“嘿呀，多么奇妙的运气！”他惊叫道，“这里有一朵红玫瑰！我一生中从来没有看见过这样的玫瑰花儿。	6
1165	这就是他的求婚活动，整整持续了一个夏天。	7
1166	'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with, but, of course, that is not my fault.	5
1167	That is the new method.	7
1168	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	3
1169	'Truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'it was even as thou sayest.'	0
1170	“我们现在睡一会儿吧，”他们说,“等我们醒了，水壶也烧开了他们躺在草地上，闭上了眼睛。	4
1171	And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.	7
1172	But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.	1
1173	然后他轻轻地绕着床飞,用翅膀往小男孩儿的脑门儿上扇风。	0
1174	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
1175	“敏感的人嘛，因为他长了一脚鸡眼,就总是踩别人的脚趾头。”焰火筒悄悄地说,爆竹听了差点儿大笑起来。	8
1176	Is the story about me? asked the Water-rat.	0
1177	For a red rose? they cried, "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	5
1178	她的直径有三英尺半宽，是用最好的黑色火药做的。	7
1179	中午时分大学生打开他的窗户向外张望。	7
1180	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
1181	“这下有好看的了，”火箭嚷嚷说,“他们要在光天化日下送我上天了，这样谁都可以看见我了。”	7
1182	第二天大清早，市长在市议员们的陪同下从同隹像下的广场走过。	8
1183	“我的朋友正在尼罗河上飞来飞去,跟大荷花说话呢。	0
1184	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“难道你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	7
1185	And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.	6
1186	What I sing of, he suffers--what is joy to me, to him is pain.	1
1187	“好听啊！好听啊！”	0
1188	And wherever the Star–Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star–Child bade them do, that did they.	8
1189	So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.	8
1190	他的双翼是火焰色的，他的身体像火焰一样有色彩。	0
1191	“争论是俗不可耐的事，在上流社会里谁都这样看。	0
1192	Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.	1
1193	Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.	8
1194	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
1195	我很高兴我旅行过。	0
1196	第二天，燕子飞到了海港。	7
1197	“不管哪里，只要你爱它，那儿就是你的世界。”一个转轮焰火忧心忡忡地说。她老早就被缚在了一个旧松木盒子上,颇为她破碎的心感到自豪,“可是爱这东西不再时髦了，全让诗人扼杀了。	0
1198	她的脸色苍白异常，她坐着雪橇穿过街心时，所有的人都暗暗惊奇。	6
1199	Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.'	8
1200	“这真是一场可笑的恋爱别的燕子都叽叽喳喳地说，“瞧那芦苇不趁钱,亲戚倒有一大群。”这倒是实情，河里到处长满了芦苇。	5
1201	'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day.	1
1202	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?'	3
1203	“有人开始赏识我了，”他惊叫道,“这一定是某个了不起的崇拜者送来的。	0
1204	'Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'	6
1205	Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.	6
1206	“啊，幸福取决于多么细小的事情！我读了圣哲们写下的所有书籍，精通了哲学的所有奥秘，可是就因为没有一朵红玫瑰,我的生活就倒霉了。” 	7
1207	Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.'	0
1208	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
1209	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	5
1210	瞧，要是你能像牛一样犁地，像马一样拉车，像柯利狗一样看护羊群，那你才算得上个人物呢。”	5
1211	You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'	7
1212	不过我不计较你的无知。	4
1213	我永远都对付不了这种事。”	3
1214	But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.	1
1215	'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'	0
1216	“你有啥权利高兴？	8
1217	整个夜晚她都用胸膛顶着刺儿唱歌，皎洁的冷月探着身子在聆听。	0
1218	实际上，爱情也确实不切实际，而在这个时代，讲究实际才是一切,我还是回到哲学那里，钻研玄学吧。” 	1
1219	事实上，他误以为我是宫廷的一位权贵呢!”	0
1220	国宴过后是舞会。	7
1221	在一座桥拱下面，两个小男孩儿紧紧依偎着取暖。	1
1222	砰！砰！砰！火药炸得震天响。	6
1223	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
1224	Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"	7
1225	And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend? asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.	4
1226	“我敢说他难得有这样的机会换换脑子。	7
1227	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	5
1228	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的做吧。”	6
1229	“我是快乐王子。”	0
1230	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
1231	于是他们把快乐王子的塑像拉倒了。	1
1232	He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.	0
1233	他飞过卖火柴的小女孩儿身旁，他把蓝宝石放在了她的手掌上。	0
1234	'We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,' said the Miller, 'and wondered how you were getting on.'	8
1235	“府，鸭子说,她生就一副和事佬脾气，从来不跟任何人争论，“萝卜白菜，各有所爱。	4
1236	它就像那月儿，天长地久。	7
1237	“她有模有样，”他边自言自语，边从树林穿过去------“这是没法否定她的,可是她有感情吗？	5
1238	But the Star–Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.	0
1239	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	0
1240	事实上，你应该学习我的榜样。你能有我这样的榜样真是算你走运。	6
1241	“为了一朵红玫瑰，要豁上性命，这代价太大了，”夜莺尖声叫道，“生命对谁来说都非常宝贵。	1
1242	大学生从草地上抬头看，听着，但是他听不懂夜莺在跟他说些什么，因为他只知道书本里写的那些东西。	1
1243	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
1244	Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.	0
1245	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
1246	She would not sacrifice herself for others.	5
1247	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.'	1
1248	大白鸭长着两条黄腿，带蹉的爪子,就因为她走路摇摇摆摆，被认为是大美人儿一个。	0
1249	And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.	7
1250	商人有钱得不到它，金子的分量和它不可同日而语。”	7
1251	但是转轮焰火摇了摇头：	5
1252	You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads, she kept saying to them, and every now and then she showed them how it was done.	6
1253	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
1254	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
1255	我称你这种行为是自私，而自私是顶顶讨厌的玩意儿，尤其我这种脾气受不了，因我生来就富有同情心，谁都知道的。	4
1256	“我的玫瑰是黄色的，”玫瑰树回答说，“黄得像坐在琥珀御座上的美人鱼的头发，甚至比割草人挥起大镰刀割过的草地中的黄水仙还鲜黄。	0
1257	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
1258	过了一会儿，一只大白鸭朝这儿游了过来。	6
1259	新娘是一位俄罗斯公主，坐着六只驯鹿拉的雪橇从芬兰一路赶来了。	6
1260	“负情！”那姑娘说，	5
1261	王子和公主坐在大厅的首席，喝干了一水晶杯酒。	4
1262	我生养了六个美丽的女儿，我很担心狗鱼碰见她们。	3
1263	他趁面包师不注意时在作坊门外捡吃些面包渣儿，使劲儿拍打翅膀让自己暖和一些。	8
1264	“我的玫瑰是红色的，”玫瑰树回答说，“红得像鸽子的爪子，甚至比海洋深洞里的珊瑚大扇叶还要红。	0
1265	第二天一整天他都落在王子的肩膀上，跟王子讲他在异国他乡经历的事情。	0
1266	“这是因为你干了一件好事啊。”王子说。	4
1267	他们把柴火堆成了堆，火箭放在了最上面，然后点上了火。	8
1268	She has form, he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove--"that cannot be denied to her, but has she got feeling?	5
1269	“我活着时，曾有一颗常人的心。塑像回答说，“我那时不知道泪水是什么，因为我生在逍遥宫里，忧愁是没法进那里的。	1
1270	He said to the Mole, 'Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother there?'	3
1271	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
1272	已经是冬天了，”燕子回答说，“这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	3
1273	All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."	5
1274	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
1275	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	6
1276	And the Linnet answered, 'Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
1277	Tell it to me, said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."	4
1278	So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
1279	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。”	4
1280	他正努力给剧院导演完成一个剧本，可是他冻得不行，写不下去了。	8
1281	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
1282	I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.'	7
1283	说真的，每当我想到我举足轻重的身份,我就感动得直掉泪。	0
1284	And one of them said to the other: 'This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?	5
1285	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
1286	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
1287	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
1288	花瓣儿的脉带变红了,花心红得像一枚红宝石。	0
1289	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
1290	“我知道我会飞得比星星还高，比月亮还高，比太阳还高。	7
1291	“焰火是个啥样子呢？”一天早上，她问王子说，边说边在平台上走动着。	7
1292	它比祖母绿还贵，比精美的蛋白石还值钱。	7
1293	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
1294	起初花儿苍白得像悬浮在河面上的薄雾一苍白得像早晨的纤脚，然后它变成了银白色，活像拂晓的双翼。	0
1295	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
1296	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
1297	我也许会回到宫廷去，因为我知道我命中注定要给这世界带来轰动。”	7
1298	“谢谢你，小燕子。”王子说。	4
1299	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
1300	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
1301	花园周围修筑了很高很高的墙，可是我对高墙外是什么景象漠不关心，我身边的一切都非常美妙，无可挑剔啊。	8
1302	然而，圣栎树听明白了，觉得好难过,因他很喜欢这只在他的枝杈上筑窝的小夜莺。	1
1303	这绝唱随着河流的浪头漂去，把它的余音一直传向大海。	7
1304	她像影子一样掠过花园，像影子一样穿过树林。	0
1305	“天哪！”小爆筒说，“我过去想得正好相反，以为我是沾了王子的光才被燃放的。	6
1306	Be happy, cried the Nightingale, "be happy, you shall have your red rose.	0
1307	这是美丽的德行，我这种德行可非一日之功。	0
1308	玫瑰树顶端的花枝绽开了一朵奇异的玫瑰花，花瓣儿连着花瓣儿，就像歌儿连着歌儿。	6
1309	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,' and they drave him out of the garden.	2
1310	所谓同情就是这么回事。	4
1311	你认为今天下午会有雨吗？	7
1312	“快瞧瞧那些黄郁金香。	0
1313	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.'	2
1314	随后十点钟敲响了，然后是---点,然后是十二点，午夜钟声敲完最后一下时,每个人都走出房子，来到阳台，国王命人去叫皇家焰火匠。	7
1315	“我歌唱的东西，他受不了,我欢喜的东西，在他是痛苦。	2
1316	'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.	1
1317	His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense."	7
1318	爆竹嘣嘣地回应着，快活得无以言表。	0
1319	在高高的城市上空，一根顶天立地的柱子上站立着快乐王子的塑像。	0
1320	第二天，一帮干活儿的人来打扫场地。	7
1321	“多么可爱的一小块玻璃啊！”小姑娘惊叫道,随后她一路笑着跑回家去了。	6
1322	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
1323	'Nay,' said the Star–Child, 'but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.'	5
1324	Flamecoloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.	6
1325	'Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.'	4
1326	国王的儿子要结婚，各种大庆小庆是少不了的。	0
1327	It took him the whole day to get there and back, and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.	0
1328	And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.	7
1329	All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.	1
1330	“我不希望争论,青蛙扬扬得意地说，	0
1331	火箭完全湿透了，要点燃他得花很长，非凡的火箭时间，	8
1332	'金棍子'才是很有礼貌的称呼。	0
1333	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
1334	“我到哪里去寄宿昵？”他心想，“但愿这城里事先有所准备才是。”	7
1335	Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.	6
1336	这当然是天寒地冻的结果。	6
1337	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
1338	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
1339	But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?	4
1340	“明天晚上王子要举行舞会年轻的大学生嘟哝道，“我的情人会做我的舞伴儿。	7
1341	“焰火就像北极光，”国王说,他惯爱抢答问别人的问题。“只是更普通一点。“	6
1342	“我就住那儿去吧。”他叫道，“那是个好去处，新鲜空气有的是。”	0
1343	他们都极讲实际，一旦反对什么，一概称之为蒙人。	4
1344	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
1345	你肚子里什么都没有，整个儿一个草包。	5
1346	我母亲活着风光时是赫赫有名的转轮焰火，她的舞姿风流绰约是尽人皆知的。	7
1347	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	0
1348	珍珠和石榴买不来它,它根本不在市场上明码标价。	7
1349	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
1350	His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire, but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.	7
1351	But pray go on with your story.	8
1352	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
1353	那朵奇异的玫瑰渐渐变红了，像天东边岀现的红霞。	0
1354	你今晚要把它别在你的心口旁，我们一起跳舞时，它会告诉你我是多么爱你。”	7
1355	“早死净了。”转轮焰火念叨说，睡了过去。	1
1356	随后他剩下的只有棍子了,棍子落在了正在水沟旁溜达的鹅的背上。	0
1357	他的头发焦黄干涩，嘴唇红得如石榴，眼睛很大的却混沌不清。	8
1358	他只要开口说话就先咳嗽起来，把别人的注意力吸引过来。	7
1359	And the Woodcutter answered, 'Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.'	0
1360	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
1361	“得了，你根本就不认识他焰火筒嗷嗷回击说。	5
1362	事实上，只是在昨天我才听见农夫妻子跟她母亲说，因为我们唱歌她一夜都没有合眼。	0
1363	So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	0
1364	只有一件事情伴随终生，那就是念念不忘别人谁都有远不如人的一面，我一辈子都在培养这种感觉。	4
1365	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	1
1366	“你完全是一个惹人生气的家伙，”火箭说，“没有一点儿教养。	2
1367	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
1368	亲爰的王子，我必须离开你，可我永远不会忘记你，明年春天我会给你带回两颗美丽的宝石，安放在你忍痛割爱的那些地方。	1
1369	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
1370	于是她展开她那棕色的翅膀，直冲云霄。	0
1371	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	0
1372	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
1373	我死后，他们把我安置在这顶天立地的地儿，我一下看见了这城里的一切丑陋和苦难,虽然我的心是铅做的，可我还是忍不住哭泣啊。”	8
1374	“焰火技术，焰火技术，你是指这个呀，一只信号焰火说，“我知道是说焰火技术，因为看见我自己的弹筒上写着这个词儿。”	6
1375	I am afraid not.	5
1376	How should I fly?'	5
1377	When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.	6
1378	夜莺于是飞到了生长在那个大学生窗下的玫瑰树上。	6
1379	“我的好人儿，”火箭大声嚷道,那声音听来十分傲慢，“我看你是属于下层阶级的。	8
1380	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你愿意和我呆上一个夜晚，给我当当送信人吗？	7
1381	“我的玫瑰是白色的，”玫瑰树回答道，“白得像海浪的泡沫，甚至比山头的冰雪还要洁白。	0
1382	然后，他戴上帽子，手里拿着这朵玫瑰花儿，向教授的住宅跑去。	5
1383	The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.	5
1384	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
1385	“办法倒是有的，”玫瑰树回答说,“可是那办法太可怕，我都不敢告诉你。”	3
1386	随后，一只小青蛙，眼睛明亮得像珠子,身穿一件绿色斑纹的外衣，游到他跟前来了。	7
1387	'They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, 'and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
1388	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
1389	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	0
1390	If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.	7
1391	但是那刺儿还没有戳到她的心,所以玫瑰的心还是白的，偏偏只有但写的心血才能将玫瑰的心染红了。	7
1392	'How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, 'really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
1393	房子的一扇窗户开着，我从窗子看见一个女人坐在桌子前面。她的脸又瘦又憔悴，一双手红红的，很粗糙，被针扎 得到处是针眼儿，因为她是做针线的女工。	1
1394	And the Star–Child answered, 'I have it not.'	8
1395	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
1396	“我还能给他送去一颗红宝石吗？ ”	6
1397	死神是睡眠的好兄弟,不对吗？”	4
1398	“真是奇怪，”他说，“天气虽然这么冷，我现在却觉得身上热乎乎的。”	0
1399	The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.	0
1400	我是一枚非凡的火箭,父母也出类拔萃。	7
1401	And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.	6
1402	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	0
1403	Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.	4
1404	'Alas! my son,' she cried, 'wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
1405	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	4
1406	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	0
1407	My roses are red, it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.	0
1408	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
1409	我就这样生活了一辈子，又这样死去了。	8
1410	“你们怎么知道的？”刻板的校长发问道，“你们又从来没见过天使什么样 子。	5
1411	最后他飞到了那户穷人家，向里看去。	8
1412	Snare them not for thy pleasure.	4
1413	“我们用它来烧火吧！”另一个男孩儿说，“水壶里的水能快点开。”	7
1414	给我个阴雨天儿让我呆在水沟里，我就很幸福了。	0
1415	If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.	7
1416	他整夜遥望星星,晨星亮起时他就高兴得叫唤一声，然后就悄无声息了。	0
1417	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, 'I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.	0
1418	真的，《宫廷报》称赞他是焰火艺术的最好范例呢。	0
1419	I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood.	1
1420	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	2
1421	“的确是悦耳的声音，”青蛙接着说，“我希望你也到那鸭子水塘去吧。	0
1422	“是我自己的。”每一个市议员都说，他们就吵了起来。	7
1423	于是，夜莺给圣栎树唱歌儿，她的声音好像水从银壶里泻岀来那样叮咚作响。	0
1424	可他母亲只能给他白开水喝，于是他就委屈得哭啊哭啊。	1
1425	她在往一件缎子外衣上绣西番莲，让女王最可爱的宫女穿上参加下一次宫廷舞会呢。	8
1426	她的歌儿越来越细弱，她觉得有什么东西堵住了她的喉咙。	3
1427	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	4
1428	在屋子角落的床上，她的小孩儿躺着生病。	8
1429	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	0
1430	他飞遍了公共场合所有的古迹，在教堂陡直的屋顶上呆了很长时间。	8
1431	她不会为了别人牺牲自己。	5
1432	“明天我的朋友都会飞往‘第二大瀑布’了。	7
1433	“我看他们是要留着我派什么大用场吧，”火箭说，“肯定就是这么回事他于是摆出一副更加目空一切的样子。	7
1434	红宝石会比红玫瑰还红，蓝宝石会比大海还蓝。”	7
1435	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
1436	他飞进了黑賤駿的小巷，看见挨饿的孩子面色惨白,无可奈何地望着黑乎乎的街道。	1
1437	“他在为一呆红玫瑰哭泣呢。”夜莺说。	5
1438	白天我和我的小伙伴儿在花园里玩耍，晩上我在大厅里领头跳舞。	0
1439	实际上，她和大多数艺术家没有什么两样,她就是花架子，不讲一点真诚。	5
1440	一天夜里，这城市飞来一只小燕子。 	7
1441	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	7
1442	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	0
1443	“再见了，亲爰的王子！”他小声说，“你能让我亲亲你的手吗？ ”	7
1444	“喂！”一个男孩儿叫道，“快看这根旧棍子！多奇怪，它怎么到这里来了？”他从水沟里捡起火箭。	6
1445	And he bound the eyes of the Star–Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.	6
1446	All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.	7
1447	“我们真得发表一份告示，禁止鸟类死在这里。”	7
1448	可是玫瑰树又摇起头来。	5
1449	他是在春天早些时候遇见她的，当时他追着一只大黄蛾子飞到了河边，一下就被她那纤纤细腰迷住了,忍不住停下来和她搭话。	6
1450	啊!	6
1451	On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron–shod boots upon the caked snow.	8
1452	Ungrateful! said the girl.	6
1453	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
1454	如果他们失去了他们唯一的儿子,，非凡的火箭那说什么话也枉然。	2
1455	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
1456	我经常自己滔滔不绝地说个没完，而且我这人学问太大了,我说的话有时连我自己也搞不懂。”	0
1457	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	2
1458	嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他径直飞向了天。	0
1459	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
1460	Only a Student.	6
1461	“天哪！难道他不是一尊实心金塑像吗？”	6
1462	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
1463	Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France.	0
1464	'Follow me,' cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.	7
1465	随后小爆筒到处飞舞，信号焰火把一切染得火红。	0
1466	当然当然,我知道一谈到有趣的话题，就准有人横加打断。	5
1467	随后，她终于爆发了一阵绝唱。	6
1468	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
1469	'Well, the fact is,' said Hans, 'that I was obliged to.	8
1470	Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
1471	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
1472	And who giveth us food?'	3
1473	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我来给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	0
1474	他飞过了宫殿上空，听见了舞会的声音。	6
1475	“胡说八道！”大焰火筒说，“浪漫情调从来不死。	2
1476	“哦，真的，”一枚流星火花大声应道，“为什么要不高兴呢？这正是找乐子的机会，我飞上蓝天时，还打算把这一切都告诉星星呢。	6
1477	我的父亲和我一样，是一枚火箭,法国血统。	7
1478	Yes, that is just what I want to know, said the Duck, and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.	6
1479	但是，火大没湿柴，他终于被点燃了。	7
1480	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，“你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	2
1481	But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.	4
1482	玫瑰树顶端花枝上的那朵玫瑰花哟，开得仿佛一面银镜里的玫瑰花影,又好像水池里一朵玫瑰的倒影。	0
1483	真的，早些时候我在一次会议上当过主席,我们通过了一项项决议，谴责一切我们不喜欢的东西。	4
1484	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	0
1485	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	2
1486	But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.	4
1487	“哑火箭？哑火箭？”他在空中打着转儿自问道，“不可能！'大火箭，'这才该是刚才那个人说的话。	7
1488	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
1489	“我毫不怀疑对你来说非常重要，”火箭回答说，“不过要是我愿意，我就会哭。”他还真的泪如泉涌，像雨珠儿一样顺着他的棍子往下流，差一点儿把两只小甲虫淹死,这两只小家伙正在琢磨一起修房盖屋,找一处干爽的地方躲避风雨。	4
1490	She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried the young Student, "but in all my garden there is no red rose."	7
1491	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
1492	Then she gave one last burst of music.	7
1493	他确实备受仰慕。	4
1494	But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, 'Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?	7
1495	However, he was so young that you must excuse him."	8
1496	'A plank of wood'! said the Miller, 'why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.	0
1497	啄出我的另一眼睛，快去送给她，那样她父亲就不会打她了。”	4
1498	“旧棍子！”火箭说，“不可能！金棍子，这才是他应该叫的。	0
1499	后来，天下雪了，雪后天寒地冻。	7
1500	And the Squirrel answered, 'Thou hast slain mine.	1
1501	最后一项庆祝活动是大放焰火，在午夜时分准时开始。	7
1502	随后又一滴水落了下来。	8
1503	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
1504	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说,他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
1505	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	0
1506	There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.	0
1507	'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.	7
1508	那年轻的大学生还躺在草地上，和她飞走时看见的一样，他那双美丽的眼睛里的泪水还没干呢。	1
1509	And he answered, 'My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.'	7
1510	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	0
1511	哼，谁都可以有常识，可想象力呢？他们却没有。	8
1512	And an old and evil–visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, 'I will buy him for that price,' and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star–Child by the hand and led him into the city.	7
1513	于是燕子在城市上空飞翔，看见富人在他们美丽的宅邸寻欢作乐，而乞丐坐在大门前行乞。	5
1514	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
1515	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
1516	Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.'	7
1517	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.'	4
1518	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
1519	Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.'	7
1520	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
1521	“哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	1
1522	“一尊大塑像连一点雨都遮挡不了，它还有什么用？”他发问说，“我只好去找一个好烟囱去躲躲了。”他决定飞走算了。	2
1523	“今天夜里我要飞往埃及。”燕子说，为飞走一事兴奋不已。	7
1524	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	2
1525	他说话的声音非常缓慢,但很清晰，仿佛在口授研究报告，他总是俯视着他的说话对象。	4
1526	“你是谁呢？ ”他问道。	7
1527	他走进了房间，躺在他的小地铺上，开始思念他的情人儿,过了一会儿，他睡着了。	7
1528	后来，燕子飞回到了快乐王子身边，跟快乐王子讲了他做过的事。	8
1529	But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.	7
1530	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	1
1531	“跟青蛙说话没劲,一只蜻蜓说,他落在一株大棕色宽叶香蒲上，“一点劲也没有，瞧他竟然走开了。”	6
1532	不过他还是返回来了,因为他生性随和，他像一阵灿烂的金雨从空中飘然而落。	0
1533	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
1534	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, 'Why art thou weeping?	1
1535	Once upon a time, said the Linnet, "there was an honest little fellow named Hans."	0
1536	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	0
1537	And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.	6
1538	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
1539	'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble.	1
1540	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, 'He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
1541	“为什么呢？真是的。”一朵菊花也跟自己的邻居悄声细语地说。	6
1542	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
1543	“就听你一个人哇啦哇啦了。	2
1544	'I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'	0
1545	“这显然是一伙代表，”火箭说，“我得拿出点架子来接待他们。”于是他把鼻子翘得高高的，把眉头皱得紧紧的，仿佛他在考虑什么非常重要的问题。	7
1546	I don't understand you, answered the Water-rat.	5
1547	“我只是客人，一个有身份的客人。	8
1548	Nay, but it is a Star–Child,' he answered, and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.	0
1549	得，王子和公主也许会去一个有深深的河流的国家生活，也许只生养一个儿子，一个一头美发、长着一双像王子本人一样的紫罗兰色眼睛的小男孩儿,也许有朝一日他会和保姆出来走走,也许保姆会在一棵枝繁叶茂的老树下睡着了,也许小男孩儿会掉进深河里淹死。	7
1550	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	0
1551	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
1552	I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled.	4
1553	'All right!' said the Doctor, and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.	7
1554	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	0
1555	The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.	0
1556	“多么奇怪的现象，”鸟类学教授走过桥时说，	6
1557	But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.	5
1558	'What do you want, little Hans?'	7
1559	他只有再往王子肩膀上飞一次的力气了。	8
1560	市政文书赶紧把这项提议记了下来。	4
1561	'Truly,' answered his companion, 'much is given to some, and little is given to others.	1
1562	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？”	4
1563	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
1564	So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.	6
1565	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
1566	恐怕是没有。	5
1567	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
1568	“我们饿得不行了！ ”他们叹道。	3
1569	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	0
1570	And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.	8
1571	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
1572	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
1573	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
1574	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，“否则你是知道我的身世的。	2
1575	“嗨哟嗨哟！ ”他们每拽出一只箱子就喊一声。	4
1576	But the girl frowned.	2
1577	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	4
1578	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
1579	“总得有听着的人呀，”青蛙回答说，“我这人就喜欢一个劲儿说个没完。	0
1580	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
1581	'Alack, goodman!' she murmured, 'have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?	5
1582	“我在说，”火箭接着说，“我在说---我在说什么来着？”	7
1583	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	0
1584	因为侍童根本没有俸禄，这道圣旨对侍童来说跟一张白纸差不多，但圣旨就是圣旨,荣誉是不同一般的，这件事当然及时地登载在《宫廷报》上。	4
1585	'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	0
1586	就算它们是真的爆竹，那也不会比这看上去好看。	0
1587	她不会钟情于我，我的心会碎的。”	1
1588	随后他开始感到全身上下一阵奇怪的刺痛。	3
1589	一个美丽的姑娘和她的情人儿来到外面的阳台上。	7
1590	不过你可以去找我的兄弟,他生长在那个古老的日晷旁边，也许他会给你想要的东西。”	0
1591	Let me tell you a story on the subject, said the Linnet.	7
1592	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
1593	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
1594	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
1595	“秩序！秩序！”一个爆竹吆喝道。	2
1596	But the Tree shook its head.	1
1597	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	1
1598	指望别人像自己一样非凡，这显然是不公道的。	5
1599	“快告诉我，”夜莺说，“我不害怕。”	7
1600	But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.	8
1601	And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.	6
1602	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	2
1603	“这世上有人活得很幸福，我深感欣 慰哪。”一个失望的人打量着这尊奇妙的 塑像，喃喃自语道。	0
1604	但是谁都没有听见他引爆了，就是两个近在咫尺的小男孩儿也没有听见，因为他们睡得很香了。	1
1605	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	0
1606	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
1607	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	6
1608	我的两只脚固定在这底座上了，我不能动啊。”	1
1609	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受	1
1610	“这才是重要的事情。”	8
1611	'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.	7
1612	于是，他就落在了快乐王子的两脚之间。	6
1613	幸亏本人我不在乎。	0
1614	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
1615	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
1616	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	1
1617	这根本不是交谈。”	2
1618	随后他们把塑像扔进炉里化掉了，市长专门召开市政会议，决定如何处理融化的铁。	1
1619	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
1620	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	0
1621	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	0
1622	夜莺于是飞到了生长在古老的日晷旁的那棵玫瑰树上。	6
1623	“这里终于出了一个痴心情种，”夜莺说，	6
1624	Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.	7
1625	想来可怜,声音美管什么用，没有什么实际用处。”	5
1626	“你是我见过的最粗鲁的人，”火箭说，“你不理解我对王子的友谊。”	2
1627	“我们现在有面包吃了！”他们欢呼说。	0
1628	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
1629	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
1630	当然，他们永远别想砸到我,我们燕子飞得快着呢，躲躲石头是小事一桩,再说啦，谁都知道我们家的人身手矫捷,不过话说回来，用石头砍人总是不光彩的。	8
1631	可是你们这些人谁都没有感情。	5
1632	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
1633	'The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,' she murmured, 'but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.	7
1634	你真的还是不哭为好，”流星火花说，	0
1635	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
1636	Get thee gone.	2
1637	But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, 'Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill–favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.	5
1638	I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'	7
1639	“那你还哭什么？”燕子问道，“你快把我浇透了。”	5
1640	Therefore weep no more but be glad.'	0
1641	'I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	1
1642	“我要，非凡的火箭让全世界刮目相看，兴奋一阵子,我要轰动一时，让所有的人一年之内不谈论别的事，就把我挂在嘴边。“	0
1643	可是，她就是不和我跳舞，因为我没红玫瑰献给她，”他有气无力地倒在草地上，把脸埋在两只手里,哭了。	1
1644	Certainly not, answered the Linnet, "that is the beginning."	7
1645	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	1
1646	我这样的天才必有用武之地。”	0
1647	What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat, "they really deserve to be drowned." 	5
1648	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
1649	'That was kind of you,' said Hans, 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'	4
1650	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.	0
1651	Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.	8
1652	天色大亮时，他飞到河边洗了一个澡。	8
1653	的确，他只懂两种调子，却又从来弄不清楚他正在吹奏哪一种,但是这丝毫没有关系，因为不管他吹奏成什么样子，谁都得大声喝彩	0
1654	我对辛勤劳作，不管哪行都不感兴趣，至于你好像极力推荐的那种辛苦活儿，就更是躲得远远的为好了。	5
1655	他飞过犹太居民区，看见那些上年纪的犹太人在互相讨价还价，用铜秤称钱。	8
1656	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.	7
1657	'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	0
1658	“他看上去简直就是一个天使。”一群孤儿院的孩子说，他们身穿鲜亮的大红斗篷，系着洁白的围嘴，正从大教堂往外走。	6
1659	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
1660	随后，秋天来了，他们都飞走了。	1
1661	'Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?	7
1662	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	4
1663	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
1664	“我多希望能穿上新衣服参加这次盛大舞会啊。”她附和说，“我定好了在衣服上绣西番莲的,可是那个女裁缝懒死了。”	5
1665	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3
1666	“下令放焰火吧。”国王说。皇家焰火匠深深地鞠了一躬，大步走到花园的那一头。	7
1667	And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut–tree to rest.	8
1668	So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star–Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.	6
1669	There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.	4
1670	我的神经的确全都乱了套,我需要休息一下。”	7
1671	但是，快乐王子看上去难过极了，小燕子觉得很过意不去。	7
1672	And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.	3
1673	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	4
1674	But the Tree shook its head.	1
1675	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	2
1676	然后燕子飞回到王子身边。	0
1677	他等新娘等了整整一年，新娘终于到来了。	7
1678	'Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?' he asked.	8
1679	至于家务吗，这活儿很容易让人衰老，让人分心，不再想高雅的事情。”	8
1680	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, 'Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	1
1681	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
1682	三天过去，婚礼正式举行。	7
1683	我的伙伴在太阳神殿里筑窝呢，粉鸽子和白鸽子在一旁看着他们，互相咕咕叫个不停。	7
1684	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.'	0
1685	“高兴起来吧，”夜莺尖声说，“高兴起来吧,你会得到你的红玫瑰的。	0
1686	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.	1
1687	我会在月光下用音乐孕育一朵,用我自己的心血把它染红。	7
1688	可是，我一点儿也不在乎。	5
1689	So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.	7
1690	“我就只要一呆红玫瑰，”夜莺尖声叫道，“只要一朵红玫瑰啊！我真就没办法弄到一朵吗?"	7
1691	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
1692	“哎！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，“我只有这双眼睛了。	1
1693	“天怎么下起棍子雨了？”她赶紧跳进水里去了。	3
1694	她的貂皮外衣长及她的纤脚，头上戴着一顶银纱小帽子，脸色宛如她过去一直住的"雪宫”一样苍白。	7
