1	And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'	0
2	“真的就像哇哇地叫唤，哇哇叫唤当然是世上最有音乐感的声音了。	0
3	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，“不过这也不出我所料。	2
4	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.	1
5	“我想我不会喜欢小男孩儿，”燕子回答说，	8
6	Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.	5
7	实际上我发现这地儿相当单调乏味。	8
8	苍白的月儿听见了，把黎明忘在脑后，滞留在天空不肯离去。	0
9	“我觉得好凉快，”男孩子说，“我一定好多了。”他很快进入了香甜的梦乡。	0
10	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
11	王子和公主从此再没有幸福可言，他们的婚姻生活全都蒙上了阴影,至于国王，我知道他简直过不了这关。	1
12	'Buy back your wheelbarrow?	8
13	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
14	Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.'	8
15	我的臣子都叫我“快乐王子”，而且我也的确很幸福，如果开心就是幸福的话。	0
16	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
17	快啄一颗出来给他送去吧。	4
18	小燕子开始想事，很快就入睡了。	8
19	他脖子上挂着一条链子，上面坠着一块浅绿色宝石，他的手干枯得像黄枯的树叶。	8
20	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
21	And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.	8
22	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?'	8
23	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
24	So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.	1
25	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
26	And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.	0
27	“她像一朵白玫瑰！”他们呼叫着，纷纷从阳台上往她身上抛花儿。	0
28	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
29	I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.	8
30	Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
31	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
32	这样，在国王花园的一端搭起了一个大架子，皇家焰火匠将一切安排停当后,焰火们马上交谈起来。	7
33	And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.	0
34	他可以把蓝宝石卖给珠宝商，买回些食物和柴火，把他的剧本写完了。”	0
35	“回来！快回来！”火箭尖声叫道,“我还有许多话要跟你说呢。”但是鸭子没有理睬他。	0
36	他的头发像风信子花一样乌黑，他的嘴唇像他渴求的玫瑰一样殷红,可是激情使他的脸色白如象牙,忧愁使他的额头紧锁。” 	1
37	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，她就会和我一直跳到天亮。	0
38	The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain–Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice–King had kissed her.	6
39	像我这种身份的人从来都不是实用型的。	5
40	And the Star–Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
41	Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.	8
42	“我是来和你告别的。”他大声说。	1
43	不用说，他的做派显得特别高雅。	7
44	And what would you do in return? said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	7
45	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
46	No, answered the Linnet, "I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.	0
47	'Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'	6
48	“他像风向标一样美丽，”一位市议员发表看法说，一心想附庸风雅，“只是不怎么有用处啊。”他找补一句说，生怕人们会认为他不讲究实 际，因为他的确是一个务实的人。	5
49	'Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,' they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.	7
50	But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
51	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
52	只有真心相爱的情侣才能用这样的水晶杯喝酒，因为虚假的嘴唇一旦触及它，它便会变得灰暗无光，混浊不清。	6
53	他飞过河的上空，看见灯笼挂在船的桅杆上。	8
54	随后他看见了那根高高的柱子上的塑像。	6
55	She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.	7
56	“你愿意和我走吗？”他最后和她说,可是芦苇摇了摇头，她恋家恋得难以割舍啊。	7
57	Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding, and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again, and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.	3
58	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
59	她最初唱的是爱情在少男和少女的心扉萌生。	0
60	这是一场洋洋大观的婚礼，在一顶缀满珍珠的紫色天鹅绒华盖下，新娘和新郎手拉手缓缓走过。	0
61	我自己记得有一次------不过现在想想也没有什么。	1
62	她看见时便飞了过去，落在一根小花枝上。	7
63	雪橇的样子像一只金色大天鹅，这位纤巧的公主本人坐在天鹅的翅膀中间。	0
64	“大冬天还有燕子！ ”	6
65	“哦！可我们见过，在梦里见过。”孩子们回答说,刻板的校长把眉头皱起来, 一脸的严肃，因为他很不赞成孩子做梦。	0
66	“星星有多美啊，”他对她说，“爱情的力量又是多么美妙啊！ ”	0
67	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
68	Was he very distinguished? asked the Water-rat.	7
69	He said to the Linnet, 'Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst see the whole world.	7
70	“我担心它和我的衣服不配，”她答道，“再说，宫廷大臣的侄子送给我一些真珠宝，谁都知道珠宝要比花草贵重得多呀。”	5
71	And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.	4
72	But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.	1
73	他告诉王子尼罗河岸边站立的一排朱鹭,他们用大长嘴逮鱼吃,他告诉王子像这个世界一样古老的斯芬克生活在大沙漠里，天下的事情无所不知,他告诉王子牵着骆驼慢悠悠行走的商人，手里拿着一串串琥珀珠子,他告诉王子月亮山的国王,皮肤黑得像乌木，对一块大水晶石顶礼膜拜,他告诉王子在棕欄树上睡觉的大绿蛇,二十个僧侣用蜂蜜饼喂它,他告诉王子乘着大扁叶子在大湖上泛舟戏耍的小仙人,动不动就跟蝴蝶打仗。	7
74	“我早知道我会制造一起特大轰动的。”火箭喘着气说，然后熄灭了。	7
75	But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
76	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
77	我要去寻找我的女儿去了。	7
78	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: 'Wilt thou not close the door?	3
79	'And what signs didst thou find with him?' she cried.	7
80	除了非凡的火箭，每一个都表演得非常成功。	0
81	Thy mother dwells not in this city.'	1
82	“现在我要飞走了！”他嚷道，把身体绷得紧紧的，直直的，	7
83	他们的眼睛都像绿宝石，他们的吼叫声比大瀑布的呼啸还响亮呢。	0
84	只要我们一岀场,我们就会引起人们的极大注意。	8
85	不过，也得承认，她的声音有时听上去很美。	0
86	他落在一只大船的桅杆上，看着水手们用绳子从货舱往外拽大箱子。	6
87	然后他飞回来，跟王子讲了他的见闻。	7
88	But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her", and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.	1
89	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
90	“这里可不怎么舒服，”他说，“不过这里肯定是个时髦的水疗场，他们送我来休养身体的。	1
91	中午时，黄色的狮子纷纷到河边来饮水。	8
92	接下来的三天，大家都在传着一句话:白玫瑰，红玫瑰,红玫瑰，白玫瑰。”国王下了圣旨，这个侍童的俸禄增加一倍。	7
93	Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.'	8
94	“你的声音可真好听！”青蛙大声说，	0
95	“那你真应该去教授哲学，“蜻蜓说，他展开一对活泼可爱的纱一样的翅膀,飞向天空。	6
96	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	0
97	“我现在要爆破了，”他嚷道，	3
98	One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.	6
99	Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.	0
100	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
101	栖息在这绿色的林子里,看着太阳乘坐他的金马军，看着月亮乘坐她的银马车，真是一件开心的事啊。	0
102	“我很高兴你终于要去埃及了，小燕子，”王子说，“你在这里呆得够长了,不过你一定要亲亲我的嘴唇，因为我爱你呀。”	0
103	Tell me, canst thou see my mother?'	3
104	'I am seeking for my mother,' he answered, 'and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.'	7
105	他的所有穷亲戚他都从来不屑一顾,嗤之以鼻，这时却纷纷冲上天际，在一片片火光中像美妙的金花儿。	0
106	我对你别无所求，只求你做一个痴心情郎，因为爱情远比哲学更智慧------虽然哲学就够智慧了,比权力更强大---虽然权力就够强大了。	4
107	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。”	3
108	“她说过，如果我给她带红玫瑰来，她就和我跳舞。”年轻的大学生嚷嚷说,“可是我的花园里哪儿也没有红玫瑰啊。”	0
109	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
110	“瞧，快瞧！”玫瑰树招呼说，“这朵玫瑰终于培育成了。”但是夜莺没有回答，因为她躺在深草丛中，死了，心上带着那根刺儿。	0
111	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
112	Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.	5
113	Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has, and she got up from her chair and went into the house.	5
114	Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.	0
115	“去年夏天，我在河边呆着时,两个野男孩儿，就是磨坊主的儿子，总是用石头砸我。	3
116	炉膛没有火，他饿得有气无力。”	1
117	“国王的花园算不上世界,你这傻爆筒，”一个大焰火筒说，“世界是一个大得不能再大的地方，你花上三天时间把它看遍就不错了。	2
118	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
119	“我不会仅仅由于他不注意听就不跟他说话。	7
120	可怜的小燕子冻得越来越厉害，可是他不忍心离开王子，他爰他爰得刻骨铭心。	8
121	我顶不喜欢粗鲁无礼，凡是坏的行为举止我都讨厌，因为我这人特别敏感。	8
122	既然你有了机会，你就要充分利用，因为我过不了多一会儿就要回宫中了。	7
123	The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.	0
124	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
125	“那你还是不哭的好。”	4
126	燕子自己思忖道，“他可真是彬彬有礼，连说说个人意见都细声软语的。”	4
127	The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.	1
128	So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.	8
129	'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'	4
130	他一想事就要睡觉。	8
131	真的，事先要，非凡的火箭是早有安排，那到头来对他倒不见得有多好,不过王孙公子总是吉星高照啊！”	7
132	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
133	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
134	不一会儿，月亮升起来了，宛如美丽的银盾,星星一片灿烂，宫里传岀了悦耳的音乐。	7
135	How should I know?'	5
136	“有人在埃及等我，燕子说，	7
137	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of white gold?'	7
138	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
139	But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.	4
140	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
141	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
142	阁楼屋顶有窟窿，	8
143	他们不久就要到那个了不起的国王的墓里去睡觉。	7
144	For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.	1
145	“我从来没有说过我认识他呀，”火箭回答说，	6
146	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
147	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
148	“我可以爱你吗？”燕子问道，他喜欢单刀直入，有话直说。芦苇听了深深点了一下头。	7
149	他飞过白色的大理石上刻满天使的大教堂塔楼,	8
150	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
151	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
152	这里既没、非凡的火箭有社交活动，又没有安静去处。	8
153	And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.	5
154	它们是用珍贵的蓝宝石做的，是一千年前从印度买来的蓝宝石呢。	6
155	“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, "every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."	4
156	Do it no harm.	4
157	于是，他回到他的屋子，抽出一本积了灰尘的大厚书，开始读起来。	7
158	Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.	1
159	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
160	突然，一声尖厉的干咳声传来，他们纷纷四下张望。	6
161	“他的脚边还有一只死鸟！”市长继续说，	6
162	我可是宫廷的大宠儿,实际上，王子和公主昨天就是冲我的面子才举行婚礼的。	0
163	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
164	If you want a red rose, said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.	5
165	And what dost thou seek in the wood?'	8
166	我跟他们谈论漂亮的新娘时，你们会看见他们在不停地眨眼睛。”	7
167	“我们当然还得另铸一尊塑像，”他说，“那应该是我自己的塑像。”	6
168	可是我的花园里没有红玫瑰,那我只好孤零零坐在那里，眼睁睁看她从我身边走过去。	1
169	But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.	1
170	我们只好把它扔掉了。”	1
171	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
172	哑'和'大'听声音倒是挺像的它们往往也就是一回事吧。”他掉进了泥水里。	7
173	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
174	'Well, for my own part,' said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, 'I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.	4
175	Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.	1
176	但是，它们好像并没有发生多大作用。	1
177	So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.	6
178	Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar–woman.	7
179	他也算是一个政治家了，在地方选举中还总能居领先地位，因此对议会的一套行话了如指掌。	4
180	“你的画像很美丽他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。	0
181	And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.	0
182	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	7
183	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have it not.'	8
184	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
185	For I have suffered much to find thee.'	7
186	你今天晚上会听见我们合唱俱乐部的演唱。	7
187	“什么是敏感的人？”爆竹问焰火筒说。	6
188	你当然不知道这些事情了，活该你是一个乡下佬儿啊。”	5
189	In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.	7
190	'Do you really think I shall?' asked little Hans.	0
191	实际上是你应该多想想我。	4
192	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
193	我就总是想到我自己，而且指望别人也都这么做。	8
194	“在远处，”塑像接着低声软语地说，	8
195	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
196	“她刚才还像一朵白玫瑰，”小侍童对身边的人说，“可是她现在一下子成了一朵红玫瑰了。”整个宫廷听了都很高兴。	0
197	他写了一封长信寄给当地报纸，谈及这件怪事。	8
198	那个孩子渴坏了，可他的母亲干着急没办法啊。”	1
199	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
200	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
201	“我要去'死神殿'了。	3
202	“快去那个城市把那两件最珍贵的东西给我捡来。”上帝对他的一个天使说,天使给他拣来了那颗铅心和那只死鸟。	7
203	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
204	“音乐家们会在他们的乐池里就座，”年轻的大学生说，“弹奏他们的乐器，我的情人儿会随着竖琴和小提琴的乐曲翩翩起舞。她会跳得脚下生风，连地都不沾，那些献殷勤的人穿戴得漂漂亮亮,纷纷围着她打转转。	0
205	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
206	身姿优雅，高高的白色百合纷纷从窗户往里窥视，观看他们跳舞,而硕大的红芙蓉摇头晃脑，打着节拍。	6
207	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
208	燕子很容易就进去了。	8
209	'Little Hans, Doctor.'	6
210	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“在这城市的远处，我看见一个年轻人住在阁子间。	6
211	这时有---个人偶然瞧见了他。	6
212	Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.	6
213	实际上，我要高高地飞到------”	7
214	“为什么呢？真是的。”一只在一束阳光下飞舞的蝴蝶附和说。	6
215	“好开心！”他嚷道，“我就要这样一直飞上去了。	0
216	So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
217	Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar–woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.	1
218	Is that the end of the story? asked the Water-rat.	6
219	And he said to her, 'Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.	1
220	And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.	0
221	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
222	于是，燕子啄起王子剑柄上的那颗大红宝石，用嘴衔着飞过了城市屋顶的上空。	6
223	大小报纸纷纷极尽溢美之词，赞扬他表演得淋漓尽致。	4
224	But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
225	Look, look! cried the Tree, "the rose is finished now", but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.	7
226	小孩儿在发烧，口口声声要橘子吃。	1
227	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
228	原来是捆绑在长棍子端头的目无一切的大火箭在咳嗽。	3
229	你肯定会看见它们的。”	7
230	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
231	What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good."	5
232	“你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
233	'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire, 'very thoughtful indeed.	0
234	I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.	4
235	月亮升上天空时，他飞回到快乐王子身边。	0
236	明月升到天空时，夜莺飞到了那棵玫瑰树上，把胸膛顶在了刺儿上。	6
237	“我这下住进黄金屋了。”他四下打量一番，悄悄跟自己说，然后准备睡觉,可是他正要把脑袋伸进翅膀下时，一大滴水落在了他的身上。	0
238	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
239	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
240	周围变得鸦雀无声时，火箭又咳嗽一声，开口讲话了。	6
241	“她不懂得跟人说话，”他说，“我担心她就是一个轻佻女子，看她风一来就摇晃的轻浮样儿。"	5
242	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
243	然而没有人看见他。	1
244	她把火柴掉进臭水沟里，火柴都弄坏了。	1
245	Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine–forest.	7
246	我喜欢听我自己说话。	0
247	我就不喜欢那些对着洒了一地牛奶哭嚎的人。	5
248	And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.	0
249	他身边有六名助手，每个助手用一根长竿子举着一支点燃的火炬。	6
250	不管怎样，我都希望你在这里定居下来。”	7
251	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
252	小燕子于是围着芦苇飞啊，飞啊，用翅膀轻轻触动水面，激起一圈圈银色的涟漪。	0
253	回响带着这绝唱萦绕在山间的紫色洞穴,惊醒了梦中的牧羊人,	6
254	可在埃及，太阳把绿色的棕桐树照得热乎乎的，鳄鱼躲在泥里懒洋洋地打量棕梱树。	7
255	She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.	7
256	At present you have only the practice of friendship, some day you will have the theory also.'	6
257	这是我的一大乐趣。	0
258	那朵红玫瑰听见了，狂喜得直哆嗦，向清冷的晨气绽开了花瓣儿。	0
259	“我不是要到埃及去，”燕子说，	1
260	“我和你再呆一个夜晚吧，”燕子说，真的动了恻隐之心，	4
261	他还没有张开翅膀，第三滴水又掉了下来，他抬头一看，只见——唔！天哪, 他看见了什么？	6
262	燕子于是啄下来一片又一片赤金，把快乐王子啄得寸金不留,一副灰不溜丢的样子。	8
263	In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.	0
264	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
265	Get thee gone.	2
266	燕子啊，燕子啊，小燕子啊，你能把我剑柄端上的红宝石衔上送给她吗？	0
267	Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.	0
268	But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, 'Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.'	1
269	“你当然难受了！”信号焰火叫道,	1
270	“你原来一直在跟我调情啊。”他大声说，	6
271	Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?'	7
272	“我愿意再和你呆一个夜晚，”燕子说，“可是我不忍心啄掉你的眼睛。	4
273	“这世界的确非常美丽，一个小爆筒大声说，	0
274	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜 悯之情。	4
275	And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.	0
276	我们都有几手专长，这就够吃遍天下了。	0
277	And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.	1
278	然后是盛大的国宴，持续了五个小时。	0
279	Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
280	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
281	It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet, and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.	6
282	“你怎么一点儿都不像快乐王子 呢？” 一位明白事理的母亲对着自己无理哭闹的小孩儿说，	4
283	“你有什么话捎往埃及吗？”他大声说，“我马上要飞走了。”	7
284	'Lots of people act well,' answered the Miller, 'but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also', and he	0
285	I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day', and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.	0
286	And the Star–Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar–woman.	7
287	那个年轻人两手把头抱得紧紧的,一点没有听见燕子扑棱翅膀的声音，他抬头看时才发现那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在那些枯萎的紫罗兰上面。	0
288	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
289	“我根本不这样看，”鸭子说，“我看这对别人一点用处也没有。	5
290	“如果你想要一朵红玫瑰，”玫瑰树说，“你必须在月光下用音乐来孕育一朵啊，还必须用你自己的心血来染红它。	4
291	The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company.	7
292	And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.	6
293	国王吹笛子吹得很差劲，可是谁也不敢跟他说明这点，因为他是一国之君呀。	4
294	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”他干咳着，大家于是支起耳朵，只有转轮焰火仍在摇头叹息,小声念叨说：“浪漫这东西死了。	1
295	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道,	2
296	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
297	王子有一双朦胧的紫罗兰色眼睛，头发像纯金般金黄。	4
298	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
299	芦苇一贯喜欢下雨, 可那完全是为了她自己。”	0
300	It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.	5
301	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
302	我们都坐在那农夫住宅旁的老鸭水塘里，月亮一上来我们就开始合唱。	0
303	And when he saw the Star–Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, 'Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.	7
304	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。”	3
305	于是，燕子啄掉了王子的另一只眼睛,衔着飞走了。	1
306	“呱呱呱，呱呱呱，呱呱呱，”她说，	7
307	你没有眼睛什么都看不见啊。”	4
308	Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.	6
309	Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.	7
310	And the woman answered him, 'I am thy mother.'	0
311	But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.	6
312	“你说过，如果我给你帯一朵红玫瑰来，你会陪我跳舞，”大学生喊道，	7
313	That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.	4
314	You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.	4
315	Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! he cried, "here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.	7
316	The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.	5
317	And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'	1
318	瞧瞧你们还笑，找快活，仿佛王子和公主根本没有结婚似的。	7
319	'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.	1
320	浪漫这东西是老皇历了。”	6
321	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
322	And the Star–Child frowned and said to himself, 'What is this that they say to me?	6
323	这样省时间，免得引起争论。”	0
324	“我自己也曾经想介入公共生活，”鸭子说，“需要改革的事情多不胜举。	0
325	“他一定天生就具有真正的浪漫气质，”转轮焰火说，“因为这时候就根本没有他流泪的理由呀她深深叹息了一声，又寻思那个松木盒子。	0
326	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
327	His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.	0
328	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
329	多么遗憾啊！”	1
330	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	4
331	He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'	8
332	And the Hare said to him, 'The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.	6
333	“我身上裹着赤金王子说，“你一定把它啄下来，一片一片地啄，把它送给穷人,活着的人总是以为金子能让他幸福。”	0
334	“我承认她是个固守闺房，”燕子继续说，“可我喜爱到处走走，夫唱妇随，我的妻子也应该喜爱到处旅游才是。”	5
335	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.'	3
336	For I see none here but this vile beggar–woman.'	1
337	“嘿呀，多么奇妙的运气！”他惊叫道，“这里有一朵红玫瑰！我一生中从来没有看见过这样的玫瑰花儿。	6
338	这就是他的求婚活动，整整持续了一个夏天。	7
339	'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with, but, of course, that is not my fault.	5
340	That is the new method.	7
341	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	3
342	'Truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'it was even as thou sayest.'	0
343	“我们现在睡一会儿吧，”他们说,“等我们醒了，水壶也烧开了他们躺在草地上，闭上了眼睛。	4
344	And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.	7
345	But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.	1
346	然后他轻轻地绕着床飞,用翅膀往小男孩儿的脑门儿上扇风。	0
347	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
348	“敏感的人嘛，因为他长了一脚鸡眼,就总是踩别人的脚趾头。”焰火筒悄悄地说,爆竹听了差点儿大笑起来。	8
349	Is the story about me? asked the Water-rat.	0
350	For a red rose? they cried, "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	5
351	她的直径有三英尺半宽，是用最好的黑色火药做的。	7
352	中午时分大学生打开他的窗户向外张望。	7
353	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
354	“这下有好看的了，”火箭嚷嚷说,“他们要在光天化日下送我上天了，这样谁都可以看见我了。”	7
355	第二天大清早，市长在市议员们的陪同下从同隹像下的广场走过。	8
356	“我的朋友正在尼罗河上飞来飞去,跟大荷花说话呢。	0
357	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“难道你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	7
358	And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.	6
359	What I sing of, he suffers--what is joy to me, to him is pain.	1
360	“好听啊！好听啊！”	0
361	And wherever the Star–Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star–Child bade them do, that did they.	8
362	So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.	8
363	他的双翼是火焰色的，他的身体像火焰一样有色彩。	0
364	“争论是俗不可耐的事，在上流社会里谁都这样看。	0
365	Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.	1
366	Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.	8
367	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
368	我很高兴我旅行过。	0
369	第二天，燕子飞到了海港。	7
370	“不管哪里，只要你爱它，那儿就是你的世界。”一个转轮焰火忧心忡忡地说。她老早就被缚在了一个旧松木盒子上,颇为她破碎的心感到自豪,“可是爱这东西不再时髦了，全让诗人扼杀了。	0
371	她的脸色苍白异常，她坐着雪橇穿过街心时，所有的人都暗暗惊奇。	6
372	Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.'	8
373	“这真是一场可笑的恋爱别的燕子都叽叽喳喳地说，“瞧那芦苇不趁钱,亲戚倒有一大群。”这倒是实情，河里到处长满了芦苇。	5
374	'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day.	1
375	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?'	3
376	“有人开始赏识我了，”他惊叫道,“这一定是某个了不起的崇拜者送来的。	0
377	'Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'	6
378	Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.	6
379	“啊，幸福取决于多么细小的事情！我读了圣哲们写下的所有书籍，精通了哲学的所有奥秘，可是就因为没有一朵红玫瑰,我的生活就倒霉了。” 	7
380	Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.'	0
381	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
382	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	5
383	瞧，要是你能像牛一样犁地，像马一样拉车，像柯利狗一样看护羊群，那你才算得上个人物呢。”	5
384	You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'	7
385	不过我不计较你的无知。	4
386	我永远都对付不了这种事。”	3
387	But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.	1
388	'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'	0
389	“你有啥权利高兴？	8
390	整个夜晚她都用胸膛顶着刺儿唱歌，皎洁的冷月探着身子在聆听。	0
391	实际上，爱情也确实不切实际，而在这个时代，讲究实际才是一切,我还是回到哲学那里，钻研玄学吧。” 	1
392	事实上，他误以为我是宫廷的一位权贵呢!”	0
393	国宴过后是舞会。	7
394	在一座桥拱下面，两个小男孩儿紧紧依偎着取暖。	1
395	砰！砰！砰！火药炸得震天响。	6
396	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
397	Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"	7
398	And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend? asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.	4
399	“我敢说他难得有这样的机会换换脑子。	7
400	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	5
401	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的做吧。”	6
402	“我是快乐王子。”	0
403	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
404	于是他们把快乐王子的塑像拉倒了。	1
405	He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.	0
406	他飞过卖火柴的小女孩儿身旁，他把蓝宝石放在了她的手掌上。	0
407	'We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,' said the Miller, 'and wondered how you were getting on.'	8
408	“府，鸭子说,她生就一副和事佬脾气，从来不跟任何人争论，“萝卜白菜，各有所爱。	4
409	它就像那月儿，天长地久。	7
410	“她有模有样，”他边自言自语，边从树林穿过去------“这是没法否定她的,可是她有感情吗？	5
411	But the Star–Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.	0
412	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	0
413	事实上，你应该学习我的榜样。你能有我这样的榜样真是算你走运。	6
414	“为了一朵红玫瑰，要豁上性命，这代价太大了，”夜莺尖声叫道，“生命对谁来说都非常宝贵。	1
415	大学生从草地上抬头看，听着，但是他听不懂夜莺在跟他说些什么，因为他只知道书本里写的那些东西。	1
416	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
417	Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.	0
418	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
419	She would not sacrifice herself for others.	5
420	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.'	1
421	大白鸭长着两条黄腿，带蹉的爪子,就因为她走路摇摇摆摆，被认为是大美人儿一个。	0
422	And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.	7
423	商人有钱得不到它，金子的分量和它不可同日而语。”	7
424	但是转轮焰火摇了摇头：	5
425	You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads, she kept saying to them, and every now and then she showed them how it was done.	6
426	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
427	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
428	我称你这种行为是自私，而自私是顶顶讨厌的玩意儿，尤其我这种脾气受不了，因我生来就富有同情心，谁都知道的。	4
429	“我的玫瑰是黄色的，”玫瑰树回答说，“黄得像坐在琥珀御座上的美人鱼的头发，甚至比割草人挥起大镰刀割过的草地中的黄水仙还鲜黄。	0
430	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
431	过了一会儿，一只大白鸭朝这儿游了过来。	6
432	新娘是一位俄罗斯公主，坐着六只驯鹿拉的雪橇从芬兰一路赶来了。	6
433	“负情！”那姑娘说，	5
434	王子和公主坐在大厅的首席，喝干了一水晶杯酒。	4
435	我生养了六个美丽的女儿，我很担心狗鱼碰见她们。	3
436	他趁面包师不注意时在作坊门外捡吃些面包渣儿，使劲儿拍打翅膀让自己暖和一些。	8
437	“我的玫瑰是红色的，”玫瑰树回答说，“红得像鸽子的爪子，甚至比海洋深洞里的珊瑚大扇叶还要红。	0
438	第二天一整天他都落在王子的肩膀上，跟王子讲他在异国他乡经历的事情。	0
439	“这是因为你干了一件好事啊。”王子说。	4
440	他们把柴火堆成了堆，火箭放在了最上面，然后点上了火。	8
441	She has form, he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove--"that cannot be denied to her, but has she got feeling?	5
442	“我活着时，曾有一颗常人的心。塑像回答说，“我那时不知道泪水是什么，因为我生在逍遥宫里，忧愁是没法进那里的。	1
443	He said to the Mole, 'Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother there?'	3
444	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
445	已经是冬天了，”燕子回答说，“这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	3
446	All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."	5
447	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
448	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	6
449	And the Linnet answered, 'Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
450	Tell it to me, said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."	4
451	So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
452	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。”	4
453	他正努力给剧院导演完成一个剧本，可是他冻得不行，写不下去了。	8
454	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
455	I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.'	7
456	说真的，每当我想到我举足轻重的身份,我就感动得直掉泪。	0
457	And one of them said to the other: 'This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?	5
458	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
459	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
460	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
461	花瓣儿的脉带变红了,花心红得像一枚红宝石。	0
462	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
463	“我知道我会飞得比星星还高，比月亮还高，比太阳还高。	7
464	“焰火是个啥样子呢？”一天早上，她问王子说，边说边在平台上走动着。	7
465	它比祖母绿还贵，比精美的蛋白石还值钱。	7
466	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
467	起初花儿苍白得像悬浮在河面上的薄雾一苍白得像早晨的纤脚，然后它变成了银白色，活像拂晓的双翼。	0
468	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
469	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
470	我也许会回到宫廷去，因为我知道我命中注定要给这世界带来轰动。”	7
471	“谢谢你，小燕子。”王子说。	4
472	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
473	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
474	花园周围修筑了很高很高的墙，可是我对高墙外是什么景象漠不关心，我身边的一切都非常美妙，无可挑剔啊。	8
475	然而，圣栎树听明白了，觉得好难过,因他很喜欢这只在他的枝杈上筑窝的小夜莺。	1
476	这绝唱随着河流的浪头漂去，把它的余音一直传向大海。	7
477	她像影子一样掠过花园，像影子一样穿过树林。	0
478	“天哪！”小爆筒说，“我过去想得正好相反，以为我是沾了王子的光才被燃放的。	6
479	Be happy, cried the Nightingale, "be happy, you shall have your red rose.	0
480	这是美丽的德行，我这种德行可非一日之功。	0
481	玫瑰树顶端的花枝绽开了一朵奇异的玫瑰花，花瓣儿连着花瓣儿，就像歌儿连着歌儿。	6
482	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,' and they drave him out of the garden.	2
483	所谓同情就是这么回事。	4
484	你认为今天下午会有雨吗？	7
485	“快瞧瞧那些黄郁金香。	0
486	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.'	2
487	随后十点钟敲响了，然后是---点,然后是十二点，午夜钟声敲完最后一下时,每个人都走出房子，来到阳台，国王命人去叫皇家焰火匠。	7
488	“我歌唱的东西，他受不了,我欢喜的东西，在他是痛苦。	2
489	'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.	1
490	His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense."	7
491	爆竹嘣嘣地回应着，快活得无以言表。	0
492	在高高的城市上空，一根顶天立地的柱子上站立着快乐王子的塑像。	0
493	第二天，一帮干活儿的人来打扫场地。	7
494	“多么可爱的一小块玻璃啊！”小姑娘惊叫道,随后她一路笑着跑回家去了。	6
495	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
496	'Nay,' said the Star–Child, 'but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.'	5
497	Flamecoloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.	6
498	'Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.'	4
499	国王的儿子要结婚，各种大庆小庆是少不了的。	0
500	It took him the whole day to get there and back, and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.	0
501	And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.	7
502	All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.	1
503	“我不希望争论,青蛙扬扬得意地说，	0
504	火箭完全湿透了，要点燃他得花很长，非凡的火箭时间，	8
505	'金棍子'才是很有礼貌的称呼。	0
506	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
507	“我到哪里去寄宿昵？”他心想，“但愿这城里事先有所准备才是。”	7
508	Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.	6
509	这当然是天寒地冻的结果。	6
510	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
511	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
512	But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?	4
513	“明天晚上王子要举行舞会年轻的大学生嘟哝道，“我的情人会做我的舞伴儿。	7
514	“焰火就像北极光，”国王说,他惯爱抢答问别人的问题。“只是更普通一点。“	6
515	“我就住那儿去吧。”他叫道，“那是个好去处，新鲜空气有的是。”	0
516	他们都极讲实际，一旦反对什么，一概称之为蒙人。	4
517	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
518	你肚子里什么都没有，整个儿一个草包。	5
519	我母亲活着风光时是赫赫有名的转轮焰火，她的舞姿风流绰约是尽人皆知的。	7
520	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	0
521	珍珠和石榴买不来它,它根本不在市场上明码标价。	7
522	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
523	His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire, but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.	7
524	But pray go on with your story.	8
525	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
526	那朵奇异的玫瑰渐渐变红了，像天东边岀现的红霞。	0
527	你今晚要把它别在你的心口旁，我们一起跳舞时，它会告诉你我是多么爱你。”	7
528	“早死净了。”转轮焰火念叨说，睡了过去。	1
529	随后他剩下的只有棍子了,棍子落在了正在水沟旁溜达的鹅的背上。	0
530	他的头发焦黄干涩，嘴唇红得如石榴，眼睛很大的却混沌不清。	8
531	他只要开口说话就先咳嗽起来，把别人的注意力吸引过来。	7
532	And the Woodcutter answered, 'Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.'	0
533	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
534	“得了，你根本就不认识他焰火筒嗷嗷回击说。	5
535	事实上，只是在昨天我才听见农夫妻子跟她母亲说，因为我们唱歌她一夜都没有合眼。	0
536	So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	0
537	只有一件事情伴随终生，那就是念念不忘别人谁都有远不如人的一面，我一辈子都在培养这种感觉。	4
538	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	1
539	“你完全是一个惹人生气的家伙，”火箭说，“没有一点儿教养。	2
540	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
541	亲爰的王子，我必须离开你，可我永远不会忘记你，明年春天我会给你带回两颗美丽的宝石，安放在你忍痛割爱的那些地方。	1
542	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
543	于是她展开她那棕色的翅膀，直冲云霄。	0
544	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	0
545	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
546	我死后，他们把我安置在这顶天立地的地儿，我一下看见了这城里的一切丑陋和苦难,虽然我的心是铅做的，可我还是忍不住哭泣啊。”	8
547	“焰火技术，焰火技术，你是指这个呀，一只信号焰火说，“我知道是说焰火技术，因为看见我自己的弹筒上写着这个词儿。”	6
548	I am afraid not.	5
549	How should I fly?'	5
550	When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.	6
551	夜莺于是飞到了生长在那个大学生窗下的玫瑰树上。	6
552	“我的好人儿，”火箭大声嚷道,那声音听来十分傲慢，“我看你是属于下层阶级的。	8
553	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你愿意和我呆上一个夜晚，给我当当送信人吗？	7
554	“我的玫瑰是白色的，”玫瑰树回答道，“白得像海浪的泡沫，甚至比山头的冰雪还要洁白。	0
555	然后，他戴上帽子，手里拿着这朵玫瑰花儿，向教授的住宅跑去。	5
556	The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.	5
557	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
558	“办法倒是有的，”玫瑰树回答说,“可是那办法太可怕，我都不敢告诉你。”	3
559	随后，一只小青蛙，眼睛明亮得像珠子,身穿一件绿色斑纹的外衣，游到他跟前来了。	7
560	'They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, 'and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
561	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
562	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	0
563	If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.	7
564	但是那刺儿还没有戳到她的心,所以玫瑰的心还是白的，偏偏只有但写的心血才能将玫瑰的心染红了。	7
565	'How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, 'really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
566	房子的一扇窗户开着，我从窗子看见一个女人坐在桌子前面。她的脸又瘦又憔悴，一双手红红的，很粗糙，被针扎 得到处是针眼儿，因为她是做针线的女工。	1
567	And the Star–Child answered, 'I have it not.'	8
568	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
569	“我还能给他送去一颗红宝石吗？ ”	6
570	死神是睡眠的好兄弟,不对吗？”	4
571	“真是奇怪，”他说，“天气虽然这么冷，我现在却觉得身上热乎乎的。”	0
572	The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.	0
573	我是一枚非凡的火箭,父母也出类拔萃。	7
574	And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.	6
575	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	0
576	Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.	4
577	'Alas! my son,' she cried, 'wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
578	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	4
579	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	0
580	My roses are red, it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.	0
581	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
582	我就这样生活了一辈子，又这样死去了。	8
583	“你们怎么知道的？”刻板的校长发问道，“你们又从来没见过天使什么样 子。	5
584	最后他飞到了那户穷人家，向里看去。	8
585	Snare them not for thy pleasure.	4
586	“我们用它来烧火吧！”另一个男孩儿说，“水壶里的水能快点开。”	7
587	给我个阴雨天儿让我呆在水沟里，我就很幸福了。	0
588	If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.	7
589	他整夜遥望星星,晨星亮起时他就高兴得叫唤一声，然后就悄无声息了。	0
590	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, 'I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.	0
591	真的，《宫廷报》称赞他是焰火艺术的最好范例呢。	0
592	I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood.	1
593	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	2
594	“的确是悦耳的声音，”青蛙接着说，“我希望你也到那鸭子水塘去吧。	0
595	“是我自己的。”每一个市议员都说，他们就吵了起来。	7
596	于是，夜莺给圣栎树唱歌儿，她的声音好像水从银壶里泻岀来那样叮咚作响。	0
597	可他母亲只能给他白开水喝，于是他就委屈得哭啊哭啊。	1
598	她在往一件缎子外衣上绣西番莲，让女王最可爱的宫女穿上参加下一次宫廷舞会呢。	8
599	她的歌儿越来越细弱，她觉得有什么东西堵住了她的喉咙。	3
600	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	4
601	在屋子角落的床上，她的小孩儿躺着生病。	8
602	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	0
603	他飞遍了公共场合所有的古迹，在教堂陡直的屋顶上呆了很长时间。	8
604	她不会为了别人牺牲自己。	5
605	“明天我的朋友都会飞往‘第二大瀑布’了。	7
606	“我看他们是要留着我派什么大用场吧，”火箭说，“肯定就是这么回事他于是摆出一副更加目空一切的样子。	7
607	红宝石会比红玫瑰还红，蓝宝石会比大海还蓝。”	7
608	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
609	他飞进了黑賤駿的小巷，看见挨饿的孩子面色惨白,无可奈何地望着黑乎乎的街道。	1
610	“他在为一呆红玫瑰哭泣呢。”夜莺说。	5
611	白天我和我的小伙伴儿在花园里玩耍，晩上我在大厅里领头跳舞。	0
612	实际上，她和大多数艺术家没有什么两样,她就是花架子，不讲一点真诚。	5
613	一天夜里，这城市飞来一只小燕子。 	7
614	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	7
615	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	0
616	“再见了，亲爰的王子！”他小声说，“你能让我亲亲你的手吗？ ”	7
617	“喂！”一个男孩儿叫道，“快看这根旧棍子！多奇怪，它怎么到这里来了？”他从水沟里捡起火箭。	6
618	And he bound the eyes of the Star–Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.	6
619	All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.	7
620	“我们真得发表一份告示，禁止鸟类死在这里。”	7
621	可是玫瑰树又摇起头来。	5
622	他是在春天早些时候遇见她的，当时他追着一只大黄蛾子飞到了河边，一下就被她那纤纤细腰迷住了,忍不住停下来和她搭话。	6
623	啊!	6
624	On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron–shod boots upon the caked snow.	8
625	Ungrateful! said the girl.	6
626	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
627	如果他们失去了他们唯一的儿子,，非凡的火箭那说什么话也枉然。	2
628	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
629	我经常自己滔滔不绝地说个没完，而且我这人学问太大了,我说的话有时连我自己也搞不懂。”	0
630	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	2
631	嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他径直飞向了天。	0
632	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
633	Only a Student.	6
634	“天哪！难道他不是一尊实心金塑像吗？”	6
635	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
636	Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France.	0
637	'Follow me,' cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.	7
638	随后小爆筒到处飞舞，信号焰火把一切染得火红。	0
639	当然当然,我知道一谈到有趣的话题，就准有人横加打断。	5
640	随后，她终于爆发了一阵绝唱。	6
641	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
642	'Well, the fact is,' said Hans, 'that I was obliged to.	8
643	Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
644	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
645	And who giveth us food?'	3
646	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我来给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	0
647	他飞过了宫殿上空，听见了舞会的声音。	6
648	“胡说八道！”大焰火筒说，“浪漫情调从来不死。	2
649	“哦，真的，”一枚流星火花大声应道，“为什么要不高兴呢？这正是找乐子的机会，我飞上蓝天时，还打算把这一切都告诉星星呢。	6
650	我的父亲和我一样，是一枚火箭,法国血统。	7
651	Yes, that is just what I want to know, said the Duck, and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.	6
652	但是，火大没湿柴，他终于被点燃了。	7
653	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，“你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	2
654	But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.	4
655	玫瑰树顶端花枝上的那朵玫瑰花哟，开得仿佛一面银镜里的玫瑰花影,又好像水池里一朵玫瑰的倒影。	0
656	真的，早些时候我在一次会议上当过主席,我们通过了一项项决议，谴责一切我们不喜欢的东西。	4
657	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	0
658	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	2
659	But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.	4
660	“哑火箭？哑火箭？”他在空中打着转儿自问道，“不可能！'大火箭，'这才该是刚才那个人说的话。	7
661	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
662	“我毫不怀疑对你来说非常重要，”火箭回答说，“不过要是我愿意，我就会哭。”他还真的泪如泉涌，像雨珠儿一样顺着他的棍子往下流，差一点儿把两只小甲虫淹死,这两只小家伙正在琢磨一起修房盖屋,找一处干爽的地方躲避风雨。	4
663	She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried the young Student, "but in all my garden there is no red rose."	7
664	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
665	Then she gave one last burst of music.	7
666	他确实备受仰慕。	4
667	But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, 'Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?	7
668	However, he was so young that you must excuse him."	8
669	'A plank of wood'! said the Miller, 'why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.	0
670	啄出我的另一眼睛，快去送给她，那样她父亲就不会打她了。”	4
671	“旧棍子！”火箭说，“不可能！金棍子，这才是他应该叫的。	0
672	后来，天下雪了，雪后天寒地冻。	7
673	And the Squirrel answered, 'Thou hast slain mine.	1
674	最后一项庆祝活动是大放焰火，在午夜时分准时开始。	7
675	随后又一滴水落了下来。	8
676	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
677	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说,他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
678	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	0
679	There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.	0
680	'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.	7
681	那年轻的大学生还躺在草地上，和她飞走时看见的一样，他那双美丽的眼睛里的泪水还没干呢。	1
682	And he answered, 'My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.'	7
683	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	0
684	哼，谁都可以有常识，可想象力呢？他们却没有。	8
685	And an old and evil–visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, 'I will buy him for that price,' and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star–Child by the hand and led him into the city.	7
686	于是燕子在城市上空飞翔，看见富人在他们美丽的宅邸寻欢作乐，而乞丐坐在大门前行乞。	5
687	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
688	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
689	Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.'	7
690	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.'	4
691	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
692	Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.'	7
693	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
694	“哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	1
695	“一尊大塑像连一点雨都遮挡不了，它还有什么用？”他发问说，“我只好去找一个好烟囱去躲躲了。”他决定飞走算了。	2
696	“今天夜里我要飞往埃及。”燕子说，为飞走一事兴奋不已。	7
697	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	2
698	他说话的声音非常缓慢,但很清晰，仿佛在口授研究报告，他总是俯视着他的说话对象。	4
699	“你是谁呢？ ”他问道。	7
700	他走进了房间，躺在他的小地铺上，开始思念他的情人儿,过了一会儿，他睡着了。	7
701	后来，燕子飞回到了快乐王子身边，跟快乐王子讲了他做过的事。	8
702	But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.	7
703	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	1
704	“跟青蛙说话没劲,一只蜻蜓说,他落在一株大棕色宽叶香蒲上，“一点劲也没有，瞧他竟然走开了。”	6
705	不过他还是返回来了,因为他生性随和，他像一阵灿烂的金雨从空中飘然而落。	0
706	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
707	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, 'Why art thou weeping?	1
708	Once upon a time, said the Linnet, "there was an honest little fellow named Hans."	0
709	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	0
710	And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.	6
711	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
712	'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble.	1
713	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, 'He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
714	“为什么呢？真是的。”一朵菊花也跟自己的邻居悄声细语地说。	6
715	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
716	“就听你一个人哇啦哇啦了。	2
717	'I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'	0
718	“这显然是一伙代表，”火箭说，“我得拿出点架子来接待他们。”于是他把鼻子翘得高高的，把眉头皱得紧紧的，仿佛他在考虑什么非常重要的问题。	7
719	I don't understand you, answered the Water-rat.	5
720	“我只是客人，一个有身份的客人。	8
721	Nay, but it is a Star–Child,' he answered, and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.	0
722	得，王子和公主也许会去一个有深深的河流的国家生活，也许只生养一个儿子，一个一头美发、长着一双像王子本人一样的紫罗兰色眼睛的小男孩儿,也许有朝一日他会和保姆出来走走,也许保姆会在一棵枝繁叶茂的老树下睡着了,也许小男孩儿会掉进深河里淹死。	7
723	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	0
724	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
725	I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled.	4
726	'All right!' said the Doctor, and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.	7
727	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	0
728	The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.	0
729	“多么奇怪的现象，”鸟类学教授走过桥时说，	6
730	But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.	5
731	'What do you want, little Hans?'	7
732	他只有再往王子肩膀上飞一次的力气了。	8
733	市政文书赶紧把这项提议记了下来。	4
734	'Truly,' answered his companion, 'much is given to some, and little is given to others.	1
735	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？”	4
736	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
737	So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.	6
738	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
739	恐怕是没有。	5
740	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
741	“我们饿得不行了！ ”他们叹道。	3
742	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	0
743	And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.	8
744	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
745	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
746	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
747	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，“否则你是知道我的身世的。	2
748	“嗨哟嗨哟！ ”他们每拽出一只箱子就喊一声。	4
749	But the girl frowned.	2
750	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	4
751	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
752	“总得有听着的人呀，”青蛙回答说，“我这人就喜欢一个劲儿说个没完。	0
753	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
754	'Alack, goodman!' she murmured, 'have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?	5
755	“我在说，”火箭接着说，“我在说---我在说什么来着？”	7
756	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	0
757	因为侍童根本没有俸禄，这道圣旨对侍童来说跟一张白纸差不多，但圣旨就是圣旨,荣誉是不同一般的，这件事当然及时地登载在《宫廷报》上。	4
758	'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	0
759	就算它们是真的爆竹，那也不会比这看上去好看。	0
760	她不会钟情于我，我的心会碎的。”	1
761	随后他开始感到全身上下一阵奇怪的刺痛。	3
762	一个美丽的姑娘和她的情人儿来到外面的阳台上。	7
763	不过你可以去找我的兄弟,他生长在那个古老的日晷旁边，也许他会给你想要的东西。”	0
764	Let me tell you a story on the subject, said the Linnet.	7
765	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
766	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
767	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
768	“秩序！秩序！”一个爆竹吆喝道。	2
769	But the Tree shook its head.	1
770	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	1
771	指望别人像自己一样非凡，这显然是不公道的。	5
772	“快告诉我，”夜莺说，“我不害怕。”	7
773	But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.	8
774	And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.	6
775	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	2
776	“这世上有人活得很幸福，我深感欣 慰哪。”一个失望的人打量着这尊奇妙的 塑像，喃喃自语道。	0
777	但是谁都没有听见他引爆了，就是两个近在咫尺的小男孩儿也没有听见，因为他们睡得很香了。	1
778	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	0
779	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
780	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	6
781	我的两只脚固定在这底座上了，我不能动啊。”	1
782	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受	1
783	“这才是重要的事情。”	8
784	'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.	7
785	于是，他就落在了快乐王子的两脚之间。	6
786	幸亏本人我不在乎。	0
787	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
788	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
789	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	1
790	这根本不是交谈。”	2
791	随后他们把塑像扔进炉里化掉了，市长专门召开市政会议，决定如何处理融化的铁。	1
792	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
793	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	0
794	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	0
795	夜莺于是飞到了生长在古老的日晷旁的那棵玫瑰树上。	6
796	“这里终于出了一个痴心情种，”夜莺说，	6
797	Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.	7
798	想来可怜,声音美管什么用，没有什么实际用处。”	5
799	“你是我见过的最粗鲁的人，”火箭说，“你不理解我对王子的友谊。”	2
800	“我们现在有面包吃了！”他们欢呼说。	0
801	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
802	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
803	当然，他们永远别想砸到我,我们燕子飞得快着呢，躲躲石头是小事一桩,再说啦，谁都知道我们家的人身手矫捷,不过话说回来，用石头砍人总是不光彩的。	8
804	可是你们这些人谁都没有感情。	5
805	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
806	'The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,' she murmured, 'but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.	7
807	你真的还是不哭为好，”流星火花说，	0
808	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
809	Get thee gone.	2
810	But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, 'Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill–favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.	5
811	I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'	7
812	“那你还哭什么？”燕子问道，“你快把我浇透了。”	5
813	Therefore weep no more but be glad.'	0
814	'I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	1
815	“我要，非凡的火箭让全世界刮目相看，兴奋一阵子,我要轰动一时，让所有的人一年之内不谈论别的事，就把我挂在嘴边。“	0
816	可是，她就是不和我跳舞，因为我没红玫瑰献给她，”他有气无力地倒在草地上，把脸埋在两只手里,哭了。	1
817	Certainly not, answered the Linnet, "that is the beginning."	7
818	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	1
819	我这样的天才必有用武之地。”	0
820	What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat, "they really deserve to be drowned." 	5
821	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
822	'That was kind of you,' said Hans, 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'	4
823	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.	0
824	Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.	8
825	天色大亮时，他飞到河边洗了一个澡。	8
826	的确，他只懂两种调子，却又从来弄不清楚他正在吹奏哪一种,但是这丝毫没有关系，因为不管他吹奏成什么样子，谁都得大声喝彩	0
827	我对辛勤劳作，不管哪行都不感兴趣，至于你好像极力推荐的那种辛苦活儿，就更是躲得远远的为好了。	5
828	他飞过犹太居民区，看见那些上年纪的犹太人在互相讨价还价，用铜秤称钱。	8
829	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.	7
830	'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	0
831	“他看上去简直就是一个天使。”一群孤儿院的孩子说，他们身穿鲜亮的大红斗篷，系着洁白的围嘴，正从大教堂往外走。	6
832	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
833	随后，秋天来了，他们都飞走了。	1
834	'Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?	7
835	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	4
836	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
837	“我多希望能穿上新衣服参加这次盛大舞会啊。”她附和说，“我定好了在衣服上绣西番莲的,可是那个女裁缝懒死了。”	5
838	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3
839	“下令放焰火吧。”国王说。皇家焰火匠深深地鞠了一躬，大步走到花园的那一头。	7
840	And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut–tree to rest.	8
841	So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star–Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.	6
842	There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.	4
843	我的神经的确全都乱了套,我需要休息一下。”	7
844	但是，快乐王子看上去难过极了，小燕子觉得很过意不去。	7
845	And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.	3
846	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	4
847	But the Tree shook its head.	1
848	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	2
849	然后燕子飞回到王子身边。	0
850	他等新娘等了整整一年，新娘终于到来了。	7
851	'Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?' he asked.	8
852	至于家务吗，这活儿很容易让人衰老，让人分心，不再想高雅的事情。”	8
853	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, 'Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	1
854	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
855	三天过去，婚礼正式举行。	7
856	我的伙伴在太阳神殿里筑窝呢，粉鸽子和白鸽子在一旁看着他们，互相咕咕叫个不停。	7
857	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.'	0
858	“高兴起来吧，”夜莺尖声说，“高兴起来吧,你会得到你的红玫瑰的。	0
859	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.	1
860	我会在月光下用音乐孕育一朵,用我自己的心血把它染红。	7
861	可是，我一点儿也不在乎。	5
862	So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.	7
863	“我就只要一呆红玫瑰，”夜莺尖声叫道，“只要一朵红玫瑰啊！我真就没办法弄到一朵吗?"	7
864	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
865	“哎！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，“我只有这双眼睛了。	1
866	“天怎么下起棍子雨了？”她赶紧跳进水里去了。	3
867	她的貂皮外衣长及她的纤脚，头上戴着一顶银纱小帽子，脸色宛如她过去一直住的"雪宫”一样苍白。	7
