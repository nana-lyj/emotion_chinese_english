1	每天下午，学校放学后孩子们都要来和巨人玩耍。	0
2	Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.	0
3	I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood.	1
4	And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.	7
5	Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
6	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
7	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
8	“他们是我的仆人。”她回答说。	4
9	“明天晚上王子要举行舞会年轻的大学生嘟哝道，“我的情人会做我的舞伴儿。	7
10	“哦！可我们见过，在梦里见过。”孩子们回答说,刻板的校长把眉头皱起来, 一脸的严肃，因为他很不赞成孩子做梦。	0
11	樵夫这时在附近一个木料场里砍木头，看见了星孩的所作所为，就跑过来训斥他说：“你真是铁石心肠，一点不知可怜人，这个可怜的女人究竟干了什么坏事惹了你，你这样对待他？”	2
12	我的伙伴在太阳神殿里筑窝呢，粉鸽子和白鸽子在一旁看着他们，互相咕咕叫个不停。	7
13	“我知道我会飞得比星星还高，比月亮还高，比太阳还高。	7
14	“有人在埃及等我，燕子说，	7
15	“富人和穷人难道不是兄弟吗？”年轻的国王问。	6
16	事情是怎么回事就是怎么回事，眼下实在冷得要命嘛。”	8
17	“秩序！秩序！”一个爆竹吆喝道。	2
18	他们走到村边时，他的同伴对他说:“你得到了孩子，那就快把斗篷给我吧,曰:星孩既然是一起看见的，就应平分才对。	4
19	The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night, murmured the young Student, "and my love will be of the company.	7
20	So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.	8
21	年轻的国王听了这番话，不由大叫一声，从梦中醒来；他透过窗户看见黎明那长长的灰指头，紧紧抓着隐去的星星。	6
22	'A plank of wood'! said the Miller, 'why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.	0
23	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
24	“我的朋友正在尼罗河上飞来飞去,跟大荷花说话呢。	0
25	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	6
26	突然，一声尖厉的干咳声传来，他们纷纷四下张望。	6
27	瞧这冷风一个劲儿往屋里刮，我都冻死了。”	3
28	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
29	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
30	And who giveth us food?'	3
31	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
32	Dear me! said the little Squib, "I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour."	6
33	宫廷大臣和朝廷高官纷纷来向他跪拜称臣，侍从们给他送上金丝袍，把皇冠和权杖摆在他面前。	7
34	他们伸开瘦巴巴的臂膊，在水里划着沉重的桨。	5
35	“那你还哭什么？”燕子问道，“你快把我浇透了。”	5
36	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
37	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
38	人们肃然起敬，纷纷跪了下来，宫廷大员们赶快把剑收进鞘里，俯首称臣，主教的脸顿时变得惨白，双手抖动不止。	3
39	第二天,这樵夫把那件少见的金斗篷放进一只大箱子里，他老婆又取下孩子脖子上戴的琥珀链子，也放到大箱子里去了。	8
40	Be happy, cried the Nightingale, "be happy, you shall have your red rose.	0
41	However, I don't care a bit.	8
42	Well, that is his loss, not mine, answered the Rocket.	8
43	But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her", and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.	1
44	巨人看着这幕景致，心融化了。	1
45	每逢他走过村庄，村里的孩子们就取笑他，朝他扔石头，赶马车的人甚至不让他睡在马厩里，生怕他会把存放在里面的玉米弄霉了，他看上去太令人恶心了，连雇工都赶他走，没有人怜悯他。	5
46	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
47	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
48	But nobody saw him.	1
49	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
50	所以我才求你跟我走的,我为了找到你走遍了全世界。	7
51	Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.	0
52	孩子们从大墙的一个小窟窿里钻进了花园，正坐在树的枝杈上。	8
53	他把它们穿在身上，手里还拿上了他那根粗糙的牧羊棍儿。	8
54	What a curious shape you are!	6
55	Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?	7
56	岸上吹来一阵轻风，甲板和大三角帆上落了一层细红的尘土。	8
57	这样省时间，免得引起争论。”	0
58	星孩拿上那块黄金，把黄金装进了袋子，急匆匆往城里赶去。	7
59	然后他们穿过许多条街道，来到一道小门前，开小门的这面墙被一棵石榴树遮掩着。	8
60	你以为乌鸦会喂我吗？你对这些事情有什么良策？	7
61	But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.	5
62	大小报纸纷纷极尽溢美之词，赞扬他表演得淋漓尽致。	4
63	And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.	1
64	After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.	6
65	我们种下玉米，我们的餐桌上却没有吃的。	1
66	“这位做梦能手在哪里？”他们高声叫道，	2
67	看哪！阳光从彩色窗户照射进来，光束在他身上编织了一件绢袍，比那件为他快乐而编织的皇袍还精美；	6
68	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
69	“我们用它来烧火吧！”另一个男孩儿说，“水壶里的水能快点开。”	7
70	“我拿着三颗玉米粒，”她回答说,你问这干什么？”	6
71	跟我走吧,我的儿子，我需要你的爰哪。”	4
72	There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.	4
73	“我从来没有说过我认识他呀，”火箭回答说，	6
74	I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.	8
75	小松鼠在杉树上过着孤单的生活，他对小松鼠说：“我的母亲在哪里呢？”	1
76	A horrible odour filled the place. 	5
77	接着他又睡着了，做起梦来，梦境如下：	8
78	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	0
79	'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.	1
80	奴隶们赤身裸体，只缠着一块破腰布,每个人都用铁链与相邻的人拴在一起。	3
81	“哎呀！我的儿，”她哭叫道，“我走之前你不吻我吗？	1
82	他是在春天早些时候遇见她的，当时他追着一只大黄蛾子飞到了河边，一下就被她那纤纤细腰迷住了,忍不住停下来和她搭话。	6
83	“争论是俗不可耐的事，在上流社会里谁都这样看。	0
84	“我不会仅仅由于他不注意听就不跟他说话。	7
85	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
86	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
87	You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow, said the Giant.	7
88	多么可怕的灾难！	3
89	但是，天哪！斗篷里面没有金子，也没有银子，当然也没有什么宝贝，只有一个小孩儿睡在里面。	6
90	空气又污浊又沉闷，墙壁湿气淋淋,淌着水流。	5
91	“快去那个城市把那两件最珍贵的东西给我捡来。”上帝对他的一个天使说,天使给他拣来了那颗铅心和那只死鸟。	7
92	他回答说：“我母亲是一个要饭的,就和我一样，我很恶劣地对待过她，我求你让我进去，她也许会原谅我，要是她真的呆在这座城里的话。”	8
93	Is that the end of the story? asked the Water-rat.	6
94	We don't know, answered the children; "he has gone away."	8
95	Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.	8
96	'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.	7
97	And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, 'My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?'	6
98	早上起来时，他从树上采摘了一些苦涩的浆果充饥，又向大森林出发，哭得伤心极了。	1
99	红玫瑰比红宝石还鲜红啊，玫瑰的叶子就是年殳扁的金子。	0
100	“哦，真的，”一枚流星火花大声应道，“为什么要不高兴呢？这正是找乐子的机会，我飞上蓝天时，还打算把这一切都告诉星星呢。	6
101	你肯定会看见它们的。”	7
102	我们都坐在那农夫住宅旁的老鸭水塘里，月亮一上来我们就开始合唱。	0
103	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
104	它们不是世人应该在意的真东西。	8
105	“他看上去简直就是一个天使。”一群孤儿院的孩子说，他们身穿鲜亮的大红斗篷，系着洁白的围嘴，正从大教堂往外走。	6
106	'We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,' said the Miller, 'and wondered how you were getting on.'	8
107	“胡说八道！”大焰火筒说，“浪漫情调从来不死。	2
108	“我到哪里去寄宿昵？”他心想，“但愿这城里事先有所准备才是。”	7
109	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	0
110	然后他轻轻地绕着床飞,用翅膀往小男孩儿的脑门儿上扇风。	0
111	How should I know?'	5
112	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
113	“你的声音可真好听！”青蛙大声说，	0
114	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
115	我们整天为他们卖苦力，他们在金库里堆砌金子，我们的孩子们过早夭折了，我们热爰的那些人的脸变得冷酷而邪恶。	2
116	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.	1
117	她不会钟情于我，我的心会碎的。”	1
118	“她有模有样，”他边自言自语，边从树林穿过去------“这是没法否定她的,可是她有感情吗？	5
119	'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'	4
120	一个冬天的早上，他一边穿衣服一边看着窗外。	8
121	Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar–woman.	7
122	“天哪！”小爆筒说，“我过去想得正好相反，以为我是沾了王子的光才被燃放的。	6
123	“敏感的人嘛，因为他长了一脚鸡眼,就总是踩别人的脚趾头。”焰火筒悄悄地说,爆竹听了差点儿大笑起来。	8
124	像我这种身份的人从来都不是实用型的。	5
125	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
126	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
127	The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.	5
128	'Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.'	4
129	“办法倒是有的，”玫瑰树回答说,“可是那办法太可怕，我都不敢告诉你。”	3
130	梭子嗖地穿过经线时，他们就把沉重的箝座提上去；梭子停下时，他们放下箝座，把线紧紧压在一起。	8
131	“我是来和你告别的。”他大声说。	1
132	'Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?	7
133	Then she gave one last burst of music.	7
134	它比祖母绿还贵，比精美的蛋白石还值钱。	7
135	丝绸床罩上绣着淡白罂粟花，仿佛它们是从入睡者疲劳的手里落下来的；高高的槽形象牙细柱子把天鹅绒华盖支撑起来，华盖上翻上去一束束硕大的鸵鸟羽毛，如白色泡沫，直指银白色的回纹装饰天花板。	8
136	Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.	0
137	“Nothing of the kind,” answered the Duck, "every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient."	4
138	Just look at those yellow tulips.	6
139	他对所有的市民都主持公道，施与慈悲；他把那个邪恶的魔术师驱逐岀去，给那个樵夫和他老伴儿送去许多丰厚的礼物，并且对他们的孩子封官晋爵。	4
140	山谷底上的稀泥里爬岀许多龙和长着鳞片的可怕东西，豺在沙滩上跑来跑去,不时用鼻孔在空气里闻嗅。	5
141	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
142	于是，燕子啄掉了王子的另一只眼睛,衔着飞走了。	1
143	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
144	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
145	The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.	8
146	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	5
147	She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.	4
148	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
149	So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
150	There is no good talking to him, said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; "no good at all, for he has gone away."	6
151	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
152	咸涩的浪花在桨叶中翻飞。	1
153	You have talked the whole time yourself.	8
154	And the Linnet answered, 'Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
155	贪婪一看三分之一的人都死了，心痛得捶胸哭泣。	1
156	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
157	他把小伙子留在身边使唤,他用清水洗过澡后，打开了一个大油漆箱子，从中取出他的皮革腰衣和粗羊皮袍,那是他在山坡上放牧羊人的羊群时穿的衣服。	8
158	他正努力给剧院导演完成一个剧本，可是他冻得不行，写不下去了。	8
159	黑人们耸了耸肩，把尸体扔下了船。	5
160	那天下午孩子们跑进来时，发现巨人躺在那棵树下死了，身上盖满了白色的鲜花。	1
161	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
162	有谁关心过咱们？	1
163	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
164	随后，一只小青蛙，眼睛明亮得像珠子,身穿一件绿色斑纹的外衣，游到他跟前来了。	7
165	“我多希望能穿上新衣服参加这次盛大舞会啊。”她附和说，“我定好了在衣服上绣西番莲的,可是那个女裁缝懒死了。”	5
166	还不如冻死在树林里好呢，要么让什么野兽撞上咱们，吃了也行啊。	3
167	许多年过去了,巨人年纪很大很大了,身体衰老得不行。	1
168	'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble.	1
169	然后，他戴上帽子，手里拿着这朵玫瑰花儿，向教授的住宅跑去。	5
170	But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, 'Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?	7
171	国王的儿子要结婚，各种大庆小庆是少不了的。	0
172	I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.	7
173	国王吹笛子吹得很差劲，可是谁也不敢跟他说明这点，因为他是一国之君呀。	4
174	May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?	6
175	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜 悯之情。	4
176	“明天我的朋友都会飞往‘第二大瀑布’了。	7
177	母亲，我当初拒绝了你。	1
178	他的头发焦黄干涩，嘴唇红得如石榴，眼睛很大的却混沌不清。	8
179	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
180	His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense."	7
181	Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.	7
182	随后他开始感到全身上下一阵奇怪的刺痛。	3
183	但是正在他们互相哀叹他们的痛苦时，一件怪事发生了。	6
184	我母亲活着风光时是赫赫有名的转轮焰火，她的舞姿风流绰约是尽人皆知的。	7
185	我对辛勤劳作，不管哪行都不感兴趣，至于你好像极力推荐的那种辛苦活儿，就更是躲得远远的为好了。	5
186	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
187	Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?"	7
188	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
189	I believe the Spring has come at last, said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.	7
190	I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.	1
191	难道你是我们老板派来监视我们的探子吗？	2
192	And he bound the eyes of the Star–Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.	6
193	And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, 'What robe is this that thou art weaving?'	3
194	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
195	星孩一听这话泪流满面，心下嘀咕道:“他们在嘲笑我，拿我的痛苦寻开心。”	1
196	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
197	他一想事就要睡觉。	8
198	Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.	6
199	Why, indeed? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.	6
200	For I have suffered much to find thee.'	7
201	“呱呱呱，呱呱呱，呱呱呱，”她说，	7
202	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
203	He said to the Mole, 'Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother there?'	3
204	于是他跑开钻进了树林，呼唤着他的母亲来到他身边，可是没有人回答。	8
205	年轻的国王大叫一声醒来，瞧！他在他自己的寝宫里，透过窗户他看见一轮蜜黄色明月悬在暗淡的天空。	3
206	他从放这两样东西的柜子里取出斗篷和琥珀链子，拿给她看。	8
207	And wherever the Star–Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star–Child bade them do, that did they.	8
208	说真的，每当我想到我举足轻重的身份,我就感动得直掉泪。	0
209	可是我不会穿这件皇袍，也不会戴上这顶皇冠，就是我去宫殿，也是不戴皇冠就去的。	8
210	“多么奇怪的现象，”鸟类学教授走过桥时说，	6
211	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
212	他趁面包师不注意时在作坊门外捡吃些面包渣儿，使劲儿拍打翅膀让自己暖和一些。	8
213	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
214	所以我一定要离开这里，走遍全世界也要找到她，直到得到她的原谅。”	7
215	随后他看见了那根高高的柱子上的塑像。	6
216	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
217	然后,他给老主教讲了他的三个梦。	8
218	不过他还是返回来了,因为他生性随和，他像一阵灿烂的金雨从空中飘然而落。	0
219	你当然不知道这些事情了，活该你是一个乡下佬儿啊。”	5
220	花瓣儿的脉带变红了,花心红得像一枚红宝石。	0
221	得，王子和公主也许会去一个有深深的河流的国家生活，也许只生养一个儿子，一个一头美发、长着一双像王子本人一样的紫罗兰色眼睛的小男孩儿,也许有朝一日他会和保姆出来走走,也许保姆会在一棵枝繁叶茂的老树下睡着了,也许小男孩儿会掉进深河里淹死。	7
222	砰！砰！砰！火药炸得震天响。	6
223	All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine."	5
224	比他过去见过的任何东西都要美丽得多。	6
225	And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.	0
226	我的臣子都叫我“快乐王子”，而且我也的确很幸福，如果开心就是幸福的话。	0
227	他确实备受仰慕。	4
228	我永远都对付不了这种事。”	3
229	Good heavens! cried the Goose.	6
230	只见她额头写着“瘟疫”二字，一群精瘦的秃鹰在她身边盘旋。	3
231	Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. 	1
232	人们笑起来，说：“刚刚骑马过去的是国王的弄臣吗？”他们取笑他。	6
233	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶哪。”	1
234	在一座桥拱下面，两个小男孩儿紧紧依偎着取暖。	1
235	But the girl frowned.	2
236	I am afraid not.	5
237	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
238	'Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,' they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.	7
239	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
240	A person of my position is never useful.	5
241	他们的眼睛都像绿宝石，他们的吼叫声比大瀑布的呼啸还响亮呢。	0
242	但是那麻风病人苦苦哀求，星孩于是对他起了善心，把黄金送给他了。	4
243	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
244	The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.	0
245	“这里终于出了一个痴心情种，”夜莺说，	6
246	但是那麻风病人一言不发。	1
247	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
248	秋天给每一座花园带来了金色的果实,但是巨人的花园却得不到秋天的垂青。	1
249	Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has, and she got up from her chair and went into the house.	5
250	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
251	他一次又一次浮上来，每一次上来他都带来一颗美丽的珍珠。	7
252	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
253	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	1
254	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
255	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任又寸目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
256	“快告诉我，”夜莺说，“我不害怕。”	7
257	“焰火技术，焰火技术，你是指这个呀，一只信号焰火说，“我知道是说焰火技术，因为看见我自己的弹筒上写着这个词儿。”	6
258	樵夫回答说：“是的，是我在树林里找到他的，就是在十年前的今天。”	8
259	Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France.	0
260	啊!	6
261	Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.	8
262	But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
263	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
264	Gold Stick is very complimentary.	8
265	我的父亲和我一样，是一枚火箭,法国血统。	7
266	那棵树马上鲜花怒放，鸟儿们纷纷飞来在上面唱歌，小男孩儿伸开他的双臂，紧紧抱住了巨人的脖子，亲吻他。	0
267	Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.	6
268	And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.	0
269	'Truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'it was even as thou sayest.'	0
270	At present you have only the practice of friendship, some day you will have the theory also.'	6
271	Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.	5
272	“呜呜呜！”狼嗥叫着，两条后腿夹着尾巴慢吞吞地在灌木丛里穿行，“这真是冻死人的鬼天气。	2
273	那棵可怜的树仍然盖满了霜和雪，北风呼呼地吹，在树梢上呜呜地叫。	1
274	“他的脚边还有一只死鸟！”市长继续说，	6
275	死亡大笑起来，拿起一个杯子，放进一个水池里，疟疾就从杯子里站立起来。	8
276	她的直径有三英尺半宽，是用最好的黑色火药做的。	7
277	In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.	7
278	Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.	8
279	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
280	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
281	告诉我，你能看见我的母亲吗？”	7
282	Thy mother dwells not in this city.'	1
283	你没有眼睛什么都看不见啊。”	4
284	The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.	1
285	In every tree that he could see there was a little child.	8
286	它就像那月儿，天长地久。	7
287	One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. 	8
288	但是贪婪摇了摇头。	8
289	She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.	8
290	起初花儿苍白得像悬浮在河面上的薄雾一苍白得像早晨的纤脚，然后它变成了银白色，活像拂晓的双翼。	0
291	至于家务吗，这活儿很容易让人衰老，让人分心，不再想高雅的事情。”	8
292	Flamecoloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.	6
293	Do it no harm.	4
294	So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.	6
295	Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'	5
296	“不吻，”星孩说，“你的样子太脏,我能吻蛭蛇和癞蛤蟆都不会吻你。”	5
297	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，”她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂，	1
298	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
299	“你说的是实话，”樵夫回答说，“可是我在树林里发现你时对你动了恻隐之心。”	4
300	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
301	房子的一扇窗户开着，我从窗子看见一个女人坐在桌子前面。她的脸又瘦又憔悴，一双手红红的，很粗糙，被针扎 得到处是针眼儿，因为她是做针线的女工。	1
302	不过你可以去找我的兄弟,他生长在那个古老的日晷旁边，也许他会给你想要的东西。”	0
303	Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.	5
304	Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something."	8
305	只有真心相爱的情侣才能用这样的水晶杯喝酒，因为虚假的嘴唇一旦触及它，它便会变得灰暗无光，混浊不清。	6
306	他们不久就要到那个了不起的国王的墓里去睡觉。	7
307	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。”	2
308	他的所有穷亲戚他都从来不屑一顾,嗤之以鼻，这时却纷纷冲上天际，在一片片火光中像美妙的金花儿。	0
309	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
310	他身边的一块毯子上坐着帆船的船长。	8
311	“我不希望争论,青蛙扬扬得意地说，	0
312	So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	0
313	白天我和我的小伙伴儿在花园里玩耍，晩上我在大厅里领头跳舞。	0
314	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
315	“是我自己的。”每一个市议员都说，他们就吵了起来。	7
316	And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.	8
317	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
318	他还很幼小,没法儿爬上树的枝杈，正围着那棵树转啊转啊，哭得伤心极了。	1
319	他穿着一身灰色服装，他吐出的气跟冰差不多。	1
320	“我愿意再和你呆一个夜晚，”燕子说，“可是我不忍心啄掉你的眼睛。	4
321	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.	7
322	How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.	2
323	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
324	但是他们信任好心的圣马丁，他对所有的行人都悉心看护，因此他们认着别人的脚印往回走，走得精疲力竭，终于走到了森林的外围，看见在他们脚下的山谷远处，他们居住的村子灯光闪烁。	4
325	“我要，非凡的火箭让全世界刮目相看，兴奋一阵子,我要轰动一时，让所有的人一年之内不谈论别的事，就把我挂在嘴边。“	0
326	It is really too dreadful!	3
327	想来可怜,声音美管什么用，没有什么实际用处。”	5
328	他勒住缰绳，说：“不，我就是国王。”	4
329	他发沉的眼睑垂了下来，一种少有的消沉一下子支配了他。	1
330	'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'	0
331	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
332	一天夜里，这城市飞来一只小燕子。 	7
333	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
334	除了非凡的火箭，每一个都表演得非常成功。	0
335	Yes, that is just what I want to know, said the Duck, and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.	6
336	'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.	1
337	And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.	6
338	他一时忘了自己的忧愁，返身跑到那儿，看见一只小兔子掉进了猎人设下的陷阱。	1
339	他对疆鼠说：“你能钻到地下去。快告诉我，我母亲在那里吗？”	7
340	“有人开始赏识我了，”他惊叫道,“这一定是某个了不起的崇拜者送来的。	0
341	“真的就像哇哇地叫唤，哇哇叫唤当然是世上最有音乐感的声音了。	0
342	Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.	8
343	“我歌唱的东西，他受不了,我欢喜的东西，在他是痛苦。	2
344	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
345	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
346	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
347	In fact, it is essentially suburban.	5
348	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
349	But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected."	1
350	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
351	年轻的国王大吃一惊，转过身来，看见一个人装扮得像香客，手里拿着一面银镜。	6
352	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."	2
353	“你有啥权利高兴？	8
354	夜莺于是飞到了生长在那个大学生窗下的玫瑰树上。	6
355	“你完全是一个惹人生气的家伙，”火箭说，“没有一点儿教养。	2
356	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
357	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	1
358	我顶不喜欢粗鲁无礼，凡是坏的行为举止我都讨厌，因为我这人特别敏感。	8
359	The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.	5
360	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
361	All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.	1
362	Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
363	Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.	7
364	但她不吃也不喝，只是对樵夫说:“你不是说这孩子是在树林里找到的吗?	6
365	他是一个非常自私的巨人。	5
366	But the Tree shook its head.	1
367	BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same"; and he fell into the mud.	5
368	The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.	6
369	“真是怪事啊！”在铸造车间干活儿的工人监工说，	6
370	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
371	They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.	5
372	So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.	8
373	他们来去匆匆，互相呼喊，没有人闲着。	8
374	“嗨哟嗨哟！ ”他们每拽出一只箱子就喊一声。	4
375	Climb up! little boy, said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.	8
376	贪婪见了直打战，连忙往头上撒灰烬。	3
377	'Truly,' answered his companion, 'much is given to some, and little is given to others.	1
378	“为国王寻找红宝石啊。”站在他身后的一个人说。	8
379	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。”	4
380	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
381	What a strange thing! said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.	6
382	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
383	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
384	街上突然传来一阵闹哄哄的喧嚣，那些宫廷大员来势汹汹闯了进来，他们手中的剑已出鞘，盾牌闪着金属的光泽，头上的冠羽摇来晃去。	3
385	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，“否则你是知道我的身世的。	2
386	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”他干咳着，大家于是支起耳朵，只有转轮焰火仍在摇头叹息,小声念叨说：“浪漫这东西死了。	1
387	Only a Student.	6
388	“我还能给他送去一颗红宝石吗？ ”	6
389	他飞进了黑賤駿的小巷，看见挨饿的孩子面色惨白,无可奈何地望着黑乎乎的街道。	1
390	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
391	And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.	6
392	When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.	6
393	原来是捆绑在长棍子端头的目无一切的大火箭在咳嗽。	3
394	“啊呀，老公啊！”她嘟哝说，“难道我们自家的孩子还不够多，你非要捡一个弃儿往咱炉边挤吗？	2
395	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
396	亲爰的王子，我必须离开你，可我永远不会忘记你，明年春天我会给你带回两颗美丽的宝石，安放在你忍痛割爱的那些地方。	1
397	“嘿呀，多么奇妙的运气！”他惊叫道，“这里有一朵红玫瑰！我一生中从来没有看见过这样的玫瑰花儿。	6
398	一天夜里，这城市飞来一只小燕子。 	8
399	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。”	3
400	“我敢说他难得有这样的机会换换脑子。	7
401	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
402	“你的画像很美丽他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。	0
403	过了一会儿，他从御座站起身，倚在烟囱的雕花斜墙上，四下打量着灯光暗淡的屋子。	8
404	“我觉得好凉快，”男孩子说，“我一定好多了。”他很快进入了香甜的梦乡。	0
405	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	1
406	Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do."	5
407	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
408	实际上，爱情也确实不切实际，而在这个时代，讲究实际才是一切,我还是回到哲学那里，钻研玄学吧。” 	1
409	What disobedient children! cried the old Water-rat, "they really deserve to be drowned." 	5
410	We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.	8
411	她的衣服破破烂烂，因为在粗粝的路上行走脚磨得血淋淋的，样子非常狼狈。	5
412	And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.	6
413	“啊，幸福取决于多么细小的事情！我读了圣哲们写下的所有书籍，精通了哲学的所有奥秘，可是就因为没有一朵红玫瑰,我的生活就倒霉了。” 	7
414	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
415	What is a sensitive person? said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.	8
416	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
417	Was he very distinguished? asked the Water-rat.	7
418	一天，巨人回来了。	8
419	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
420	我就总是想到我自己，而且指望别人也都这么做。	8
421	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
422	“我根本不这样看，”鸭子说，“我看这对别人一点用处也没有。	5
423	I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.	7
424	And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.	4
425	海盗在荒芜的海岸劫掠，把渔民的船烧掉，抢走他们的渔网。	3
426	“我早知道我会制造一起特大轰动的。”火箭喘着气说，然后熄灭了。	7
427	“你有什么话捎往埃及吗？”他大声说，“我马上要飞走了。”	7
428	“怪了怪了！”他惊叫道，“这天上连一丝云彩也没有，满天的星星亮晶晶的，竟然下起雨来。	6
429	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
430	“没事的，这可是一个星孩，他回答说；随后他给她讲了发现这孩子的奇怪经过。	8
431	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“难道你不愿意再和我呆一个夜晚吗？”	7
432	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
433	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name"; and he leaned down and plucked it.	4
434	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
435	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
436	“就听你一个人哇啦哇啦了。	2
437	“跟青蛙说话没劲,一只蜻蜓说,他落在一株大棕色宽叶香蒲上，“一点劲也没有，瞧他竟然走开了。”	6
438	已经是冬天了，”燕子回答说，“这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	3
439	星孩对他说：“我没有带来。”	1
440	“我们现在有面包吃了！”他们欢呼说。	0
441	于是燕子在城市上空飞翔，看见富人在他们美丽的宅邸寻欢作乐，而乞丐坐在大门前行乞。	5
442	But pray go on with your story.	8
443	Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.	0
444	“大冬天还有燕子！ ”	6
445	'That was kind of you,' said Hans, 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'	4
446	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
447	“我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
448	“这就是我的皇冠。”他回答说。	4
449	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
450	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	2
451	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
452	Press closer, little Nightingale, cried the Tree, "or the Day will come before the rose is finished."	7
453	And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.	7
454	帆船船长把绳梯从船侧扔下海去，把绳梯的另一头紧紧地拴在两根铁支柱子上。	4
455	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
456	一个女人罩着黄面纱,缓缓地跟在一峰骆驼后面，时不时回过身来张望那具死尸。	5
457	可以肯定的是，老国王弥留之际不知是追悔他的深重罪孽还是打心眼儿里希望他的王国能代代相传，命人去把这个小伙子找来，当着全体大臣的面，指定他是他的继位人。	7
458	You should be thinking about others.	8
459	给我个阴雨天儿让我呆在水沟里，我就很幸福了。	0
460	Get thee gone.	2
461	我的神经的确全都乱了套,我需要休息一下。”	7
462	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	6
463	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
464	Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
465	“你在这幢房子里竟说出这样的话？”年轻的国王说，他大步走过主教,走上祭坛的台阶，站在耶稣像的前面。	6
466	“他们不会认你的，陛下。”宫廷大臣叫道。	8
467	They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.	2
468	You certainly are! cried the Bengal Light.	6
469	市政文书赶紧把这项提议记了下来。	4
470	死亡大笑，拿起一块黑石头，扔进了森林，一片野毒芹丛里走岀身着火焰长袍的热病。	5
471	那块花绸布取下后，星孩知道自己在一个地牢里，那儿亮着一盏牛角灯。	3
472	小侍从见了吃了一惊，瞪起他那蓝蓝的大眼睛，微笑着跟他说：“陛下，我看你有皇袍和权杖，可你的皇冠在哪里呢？	6
473	但是那刺儿还没有戳到她的心,所以玫瑰的心还是白的，偏偏只有但写的心血才能将玫瑰的心染红了。	7
474	最后一项庆祝活动是大放焰火，在午夜时分准时开始。	7
475	不用说，他的做派显得特别高雅。	7
476	于是，夜莺给圣栎树唱歌儿，她的声音好像水从银壶里泻岀来那样叮咚作响。	0
477	但是转轮焰火摇了摇头：	5
478	燕子于是啄下来一片又一片赤金，把快乐王子啄得寸金不留,一副灰不溜丢的样子。	8
479	There was no doubt about it.	4
480	So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.	6
481	大学生从草地上抬头看，听着，但是他听不懂夜莺在跟他说些什么，因为他只知道书本里写的那些东西。	1
482	“我们当然还得另铸一尊塑像，”他说，“那应该是我自己的塑像。”	6
483	“下令放焰火吧。”国王说。皇家焰火匠深深地鞠了一躬，大步走到花园的那一头。	7
484	He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.	8
485	有一次他们陷进了深雪坑,挣脱出来就像正在磨面的磨工那样子白了；有一次他们滑进了池水结冰的光滑冰面上，他们的柴火摔散了捆，他们只好把柴火捡起来，重捆在一起；又有一次他们以为迷了路，心下害怕得要命，因为他们知道雪对任何睡在它们怀里的人都毫不留情。	3
486	来呀，我们把她赶走,因为她好丑好难看哪。”	5
487	因为侍童根本没有俸禄，这道圣旨对侍童来说跟一张白纸差不多，但圣旨就是圣旨,荣誉是不同一般的，这件事当然及时地登载在《宫廷报》上。	4
488	'Do you really think I shall?' asked little Hans.	0
489	他把一根尖芦苇刺进疆鼠模糊不清的眼睛，他们在一旁笑起来；他朝麻风病人扔石头，他们也笑个不停。	5
490	What an honour! cried all the courtiers.	6
491	A new arrival, I see! said the Frog.	6
492	He must have a truly romantic nature, said the Catherine Wheel, "for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about"; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.	6
493	可是你们这些人谁都没有感情。	5
494	他一点儿也不可怜穷人，对瞎子、残疾人和有病有灾的人，一点儿也不知怜悯，反而朝他们扔石头，硬把他们往大路上赶，要他们到别的地方要饭吃。于是，除了不法之徒，别人不敢再到村里来讨吃讨喝。	5
495	他也算是一个政治家了，在地方选举中还总能居领先地位，因此对议会的一套行话了如指掌。	4
496	And what dost thou seek in the wood?'	8
497	北风用皮外衣裹得严严实实，整天都在花园里呜呜叫个不停,把烟囱都刮倒了。	1
498	And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.	0
499	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
500	The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain–Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice–King had kissed her.	6
501	周围变得鸦雀无声时，火箭又咳嗽一声，开口讲话了。	6
502	我这样的天才必有用武之地。”	0
503	小松鼠生活在局杉树洞里，不停地互相蹭鼻子保持暖和,兔子在他们的窝里蜷成一团，根本不敢贸然到窝口来探头探脑。	3
504	“所有的人都是这样的，”织工回答说，“年幼的是这样，年老的也是这样;女人是这样，男人也是这样；小孩儿们是这样，上了年纪的也是这样。	8
505	But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.	1
506	And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.	0
507	I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day', and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.	0
508	皇袍图案出自当今最负盛名的艺术家们之手，数月前他就躬身审查，下旨交给技工不分昼夜赶制出来,并在全世界收集和图案般配的珠宝。	8
509	”他气得满脸通红，对他们说：“我就是国王。”他把他们的矛戟挡到一边，闯了进去。	2
510	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
511	我们都有几手专长，这就够吃遍天下了。	0
512	他们以矛击盾操练过了,把铁盔戴在了头上。	8
513	And the Woodcutter answered, 'Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.'	0
514	I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here."	7
515	It is going to rain sticks; and she rushed into the water.	3
516	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
517	所以你还是离开这里，别再让我看见你。”	5
518	“她刚才还像一朵白玫瑰，”小侍童对身边的人说，“可是她现在一下子成了一朵红玫瑰了。”整个宫廷听了都很高兴。	0
519	One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.	8
520	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
521	Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.	8
522	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
523	火箭完全湿透了，要点燃他得花很长，非凡的火箭时间，	8
524	How should I fly?'	5
525	”他把所有朝臣都打发走，就留下一个留在身边作伴儿的侍从，一个比他还小一岁的小伙子。	8
526	“天哪！难道他不是一尊实心金塑像吗？”	6
527	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
528	She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.	7
529	到了第三天，他来到了森林里的另一边，下到平原去了。	8
530	一个人从人群里走岀来，恶狠狠地跟他说：“老爷，难道你不明白穷人的生活仰仗富人的奢侈吗？	2
531	另有故事传说，有人看见他用温暖的嘴唇深吻一尊修石桥时在河床里发现的古代石雕像冰冷的额头;这石雕像被认为是哈德良團的俾泰尼亚人奴隶。	8
532	你们怎么能说我生得美丽呢？	6
533	“那你还是不哭的好。”	4
534	快快离开这里，我们可受不了你和我们一起玩耍了。”他们一起把他赶出了花园。	5
535	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
536	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
537	他还曾度过一个不眠之夜，观察月光下的恩底弥翁団的银塑像。	7
538	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
539	Why, indeed? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.	6
540	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
541	'Alack, goodman!' she murmured, 'have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?	5
542	第二天大清早，市长在市议员们的陪同下从同隹像下的广场走过。	8
543	浪漫这东西是老皇历了。”	6
544	他觉得他在一片昏暗的林子里闲荡,上挂满了奇怪的果子和美丽的毒花儿。	3
545	到处都是刺鼻难闻的气味。	5
546	Look, look! cried the Tree, "the rose is finished now", but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.	7
547	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
548	So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.	6
549	“我和你再呆一个夜晚吧，”燕子说，真的动了恻隐之心，	4
550	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have it not.'	8
551	那女人听了这些话，大叫一声，晕了过去。	6
552	He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.	0
553	国宴过后是舞会。	7
554	燕子很容易就进去了。	8
555	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
556	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
557	“他在为一呆红玫瑰哭泣呢。”夜莺说。	5
558	然而他根本不理睬他们，一路前行，走下明亮的斑岩楼梯，穿过一道道铜门，翻身上马，直奔大教堂而去，小侍从在他身后紧追不舍。	8
559	他把红金子装进他的袋子，急忙朝城里赶去。	7
560	他跪在耶稣像前,神龛旁的大蜡烛燃烧得很亮，香烧起的缕缕青烟在穹盖形成薄薄的雾环。	6
561	中午时分大学生打开他的窗户向外张望。	7
562	As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things."	8
563	I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever."	7
564	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
565	他站起来，再看他们，瞧！他们转眼间成了国王和王后了。	6
566	她走得疲惫不堪，就在一棵栗子树下坐下来休息。	1
567	“不管哪里，只要你爱它，那儿就是你的世界。”一个转轮焰火忧心忡忡地说。她老早就被缚在了一个旧松木盒子上,颇为她破碎的心感到自豪,“可是爱这东西不再时髦了，全让诗人扼杀了。	0
568	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
569	我也许会回到宫廷去，因为我知道我命中注定要给这世界带来轰动。”	7
570	快啄一颗出来给他送去吧。	4
571	可是，她就是不和我跳舞，因为我没红玫瑰献给她，”他有气无力地倒在草地上，把脸埋在两只手里,哭了。	1
572	每一棵树上他都看见有一个小孩儿。	8
573	Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.	6
574	窗外，他可以望见大教堂那巨大的圆顶，朦朦胧胧的，宛如从影影绰绰的房屋上面鼓出的气泡，那无精打采的哨兵在河边薄雾笼罩的台地上来回走动。	8
575	那朵奇异的玫瑰渐渐变红了，像天东边岀现的红霞。	0
576	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
577	And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.	0
578	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
579	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	0
580	And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.	0
581	“我活着时，曾有一颗常人的心。塑像回答说，“我那时不知道泪水是什么，因为我生在逍遥宫里，忧愁是没法进那里的。	1
582	“要是你真的是我的生身母亲，”他说，“那你还是离去的好，别在这儿让我丢脸，你瞧我原以为我是某颗星星的孩子,而不是一个叫花子的孩子，像你和我说的那样。	2
583	And the Hare said to him, 'The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.	6
584	“今天夜里我要飞往埃及。”燕子说，为飞走一事兴奋不已。	7
585	'I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'	0
586	And the Star–Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar–woman.	7
587	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
588	他落在一只大船的桅杆上，看着水手们用绳子从货舱往外拽大箱子。	6
589	“你是我见过的最粗鲁的人，”火箭说，“你不理解我对王子的友谊。”	2
590	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
591	请你给我爰吧。	4
592	然后燕子飞回到王子身边。	0
593	三年中他就这样在世界上寻找，这世界既没人爱他，也没人怜悯他或对他慈悲,可是这个世界正是他春风得意时为自己创造的啊。	1
594	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
595	But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.	3
596	And what would you do in return? said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.	7
597	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
598	可是守城的士兵把手里的矛枪往城门口一横,对他粗鲁地说：“你到城里有什么事？”	2
599	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
600	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
601	苍白的月儿听见了，把黎明忘在脑后，滞留在天空不肯离去。	0
602	“这下有好看的了，”火箭嚷嚷说,“他们要在光天化日下送我上天了，这样谁都可以看见我了。”	7
603	“我想我不会喜欢小男孩儿，”燕子回答说，	8
604	“什么东西？”她大声问，	6
605	珍珠和石榴买不来它,它根本不在市场上明码标价。	7
606	All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.	7
607	“好开心！”他嚷道，“我就要这样一直飞上去了。	0
608	明月升到天空时，夜莺飞到了那棵玫瑰树上，把胸膛顶在了刺儿上。	6
609	She has form, he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove--"that cannot be denied to her, but has she got feeling?	5
610	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
611	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
612	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，“这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
613	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
614	只有花园里的自私巨人还过着严冬的日子。	5
615	But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.	4
616	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
617	“这显然是一伙代表，”火箭说，“我得拿出点架子来接待他们。”于是他把鼻子翘得高高的，把眉头皱得紧紧的，仿佛他在考虑什么非常重要的问题。	7
618	He saw a most wonderful sight. 	6
619	Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?'	7
620	钟楼响起午夜钟声时，他按响了铃,他的侍从进来毕恭毕敬地给他宽衣解带,给他倒上玫瑰水洗手，往他的枕头上撤了花瓣儿。	8
621	年轻的国王又低下他的头，祈祷，等完成他的祷告，他站了起来，转过身悲哀地看着他们。	1
622	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?'	3
623	TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED	3
624	”于是他把他做过的三个梦一一讲了出来。	8
625	'I am seeking for my mother,' he answered, 'and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.'	7
626	But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.	1
627	“我现在要爆破了，”他嚷道，	3
628	When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.	8
629	他变得越来越骄傲、残忍和自私。樵夫的孩子也好，村里别人家的孩子也罢，他一概不放在眼里，说他们都是低贱的父母生养的，只有他高贵无比，是从一颗星那里蹦出来的，他在孩子们中间称王称霸，把他们称为他的仆人。	5
630	他的头发像风信子花一样乌黑，他的嘴唇像他渴求的玫瑰一样殷红,可是激情使他的脸色白如象牙,忧愁使他的额头紧锁。” 	1
631	But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.	1
632	他黑如乌木，他的裹头巾是红绸布。	8
633	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	2
634	他早先去拜访他的朋友、康沃尔的吃人魔去了，和吃人魔一呆就是七年。	3
635	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
636	I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.	4
637	Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.	1
638	The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.	0
639	星孩星孩吃过喝过后，老头儿走了出去，把身后的门锁上，并用铁链子把门拴得牢牢的。	3
640	商人有钱得不到它，金子的分量和它不可同日而语。”	7
641	所以我对你所干的事情不赞成，劝你掉转马头回宫,让自己脸上高兴起来，穿上那套适合国王身份的衣服，戴上那顶我将为你加冕的皇冠，拿起那根我将交付你手的珍珠权杖。	4
642	人群拥拥挤挤，到处都是，他迷了路，最后来到了一个大广场上，只见广场上有一座王宫。	7
643	They are like the Aurora Borealis, said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, "only much more natural.	8
644	“我的玫瑰是黄色的，”玫瑰树回答说，“黄得像坐在琥珀御座上的美人鱼的头发，甚至比割草人挥起大镰刀割过的草地中的黄水仙还鲜黄。	0
645	但是谁都没有听见他引爆了，就是两个近在咫尺的小男孩儿也没有听见，因为他们睡得很香了。	1
646	如果他们失去了他们唯一的儿子,，非凡的火箭那说什么话也枉然。	2
647	“去年夏天，我在河边呆着时,两个野男孩儿，就是磨坊主的儿子，总是用石头砸我。	3
648	He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.	5
649	他飞过白色的大理石上刻满天使的大教堂塔楼,	8
650	“我不明白为什么春天这么晚了还不来，”自私的巨人心下思忖，坐在窗前看着他那冰天雪地的花园，“但愿这气候变化变化才好。”	1
651	“你们一定告诉他务必明天来这里玩儿。”巨人说。	7
652	“我很高兴你终于要去埃及了，小燕子，”王子说，“你在这里呆得够长了,不过你一定要亲亲我的嘴唇，因为我爱你呀。”	0
653	然而，他统治的时候不长，因为他过去遭受苦难太多，考验他的烈火太猛，他仅仅活了三年就死去了。	1
654	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
655	他飞过了宫殿上空，听见了舞会的声音。	6
656	But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.	4
657	炉膛没有火，他饿得有气无力。”	1
658	“现在我要飞走了！”他嚷道，把身体绷得紧紧的，直直的，	7
659	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
660	You were talking about yourself, replied the Roman Candle.	8
661	And an old and evil–visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, 'I will buy him for that price,' and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star–Child by the hand and led him into the city.	7
662	Tell me, canst thou see my mother?'	3
663	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
664	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
665	天色大亮时，他飞到河边洗了一个澡。	8
666	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
667	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
668	That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.	4
669	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
670	I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.	5
671	当然,我们之间是有区别的------他穿金戴银而我衣衫褴褛，我饿得要死而他撑得难受。	1
672	And the Star–Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.	7
673	In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.	6
674	真的，《宫廷报》称赞他是焰火艺术的最好范例呢。	0
675	过了一会儿，他们离开了屋子,他入睡了。	8
676	他疲乏地爬下绳梯，消失在海中。	1
677	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, 'Why art thou weeping?	1
678	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道,	2
679	这根本不是交谈。”	2
680	Let me tell you a story on the subject, said the Linnet.	7
681	What a pity!	1
682	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	4
683	“在战争中，”织工回答说，“强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
684	“我在寻找我的母亲，”他回答说,“我求求你放我进去，也许她就在这城里呢。”	4
685	Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.'	0
686	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
687	小燕子开始想事，很快就入睡了。	8
688	我很高兴我旅行过。	0
689	Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.'	7
690	“这真是一场可笑的恋爱别的燕子都叽叽喳喳地说，“瞧那芦苇不趁钱,亲戚倒有一大群。”这倒是实情，河里到处长满了芦苇。	5
691	There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.	5
692	But the Star–Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.	0
693	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
694	“这里可不怎么舒服，”他说，“不过这里肯定是个时髦的水疗场，他们送我来休养身体的。	1
695	我喜欢听我自己说话。	0
696	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
697	At last, however, the fire caught him.	8
698	'Buy back your wheelbarrow?	8
699	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.	1
700	她像影子一样掠过花园，像影子一样穿过树林。	0
701	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	2
702	我生养了六个美丽的女儿，我很担心狗鱼碰见她们。	3
703	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
704	And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.	5
705	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	7
706	可怜的小燕子冻得越来越厉害，可是他不忍心离开王子，他爰他爰得刻骨铭心。	8
707	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
708	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
709	然而，最让他念念不忘的是他将在加冕典礼上用的东西：皇袍，金线织的皇袍、镶嵌红宝石的皇冠、珍珠裹身的权杖。	7
710	一个样子凶恶的老头儿正好路过，大声吆喝说：“我出这个价买下他。”他把钱付清后，领着星孩进了城。	3
711	随后他们把塑像扔进炉里化掉了，市长专门召开市政会议，决定如何处理融化的铁。	1
712	三天过去，婚礼正式举行。	7
713	Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine–forest.	7
714	可朝臣听完三个梦后彼此面面相觑,纷纷耳语说：“他一定是疯了，梦就是梦，幻觉就是幻觉，这哪儿是哪儿？	6
715	Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.	4
716	'金棍子'才是很有礼貌的称呼。	0
717	每长一岁，他就变得更美丽一些，村子里的人都感到好生纳闷儿,因为他们都生得黑皮肤黑头发，偏偏他长得又白又细嫩，像加工过的象牙一样，他满头髻发则像黄水仙的花环。	6
718	他觉得他躺在一艘大帆船的甲板上,一百名奴隶在挥桨划水。	7
719	He was really very sorry for what he had done.	1
720	整个夜晚她都用胸膛顶着刺儿唱歌，皎洁的冷月探着身子在聆听。	0
721	Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.'	8
722	If you want a red rose, said the Tree, "you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.	5
723	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
724	“快瞧瞧那些黄郁金香。	0
725	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
726	他身穿王服站在那里，上帝的荣耀无处不在，雕琢的壁龛里的圣徒们好像动弹起来了。	4
727	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	0
728	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，“你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	2
729	The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.	1
730	“你这副样子可真叫稀罕！	6
731	巨人最爱那小男孩儿，因为小男孩儿亲吻过他。	4
732	他们只好到大路上玩耍，可是路上灰尘太多，而且到处都是粗糙的石头，他们一点也不喜欢在路上玩。	1
733	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	0
734	接下来的三天，大家都在传着一句话:白玫瑰，红玫瑰,红玫瑰，白玫瑰。”国王下了圣旨，这个侍童的俸禄增加一倍。	7
735	但是他们不让进，还用他们的长矛刺他。	2
736	来和我一起玩儿吧，我不会取笑你的。”	4
737	我要把那个可怜的小男孩儿抱到那棵树顶上去，然后我再把这围墙拆掉，让我的花园世世代代成为孩子们的游戏场。”	7
738	“为了一朵红玫瑰，要豁上性命，这代价太大了，”夜莺尖声叫道，“生命对谁来说都非常宝贵。	1
739	后来，天下雪了，雪后天寒地冻。	7
740	但他的心情却十分沉重，因为他知道什么厄运在等着他。	1
741	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
742	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
743	栖息在这绿色的林子里,看着太阳乘坐他的金马军，看着月亮乘坐她的银马车，真是一件开心的事啊。	0
744	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	4
745	Snare them not for thy pleasure.	4
746	瞧，要是你能像牛一样犁地，像马一样拉车，像柯利狗一样看护羊群，那你才算得上个人物呢。”	5
747	然而星孩呆在原地一动不动，对她完全关上了心扉，除了那女人痛苦的哭泣声外，别的什么也没听到。	1
748	'It is not a very big plank,' said the Miller, looking at it, 'and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won't be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with, but, of course, that is not my fault.	5
749	我吃了很多苦才找到了你啊。”	1
750	于是她展开她那棕色的翅膀，直冲云霄。	0
751	我要去寻找我的女儿去了。	7
752	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	0
753	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
754	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.'	3
755	Come back! come back! screamed the Rocket, "I have a great deal to say to you"; but the Duck paid no attention to him.	8
756	那朵红玫瑰听见了，狂喜得直哆嗦，向清冷的晨气绽开了花瓣儿。	0
757	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3
758	她的貂皮外衣长及她的纤脚，头上戴着一顶银纱小帽子，脸色宛如她过去一直住的"雪宫”一样苍白。	7
759	所以你别哭了。	4
760	“好听啊！好听啊！”	0
761	'Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'	6
762	他整夜遥望星星,晨星亮起时他就高兴得叫唤一声，然后就悄无声息了。	0
763	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
764	这时那要饭女人把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。“	7
765	“我是快乐王子。”	0
766	这是一场洋洋大观的婚礼，在一顶缀满珍珠的紫色天鹅绒华盖下，新娘和新郎手拉手缓缓走过。	0
767	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你又寸待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
768	Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.	7
769	You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain."	7
770	She would not sacrifice herself for others.	5
771	那个年轻人两手把头抱得紧紧的,一点没有听见燕子扑棱翅膀的声音，他抬头看时才发现那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在那些枯萎的紫罗兰上面。	0
772	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:“我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
773	你认为今天下午会有雨吗？	7
774	If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.	7
775	如果你不穿上国王的服装,那人们怎么才能知道你是一个国王呢？”	6
776	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
777	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
778	每天他都在城堡屋顶上劈劈啪啪下三个小时，把屋顶上大多数瓦片都打破了；随后他又在花园转呀转呀，忙不迭地奔啊跑啊。	1
779	What right have you to be happy?	8
780	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
781	我就不喜欢那些对着洒了一地牛奶哭嚎的人。	5
782	随后，她终于爆发了一阵绝唱。	6
783	The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.	0
784	“她像一朵白玫瑰！”他们呼叫着，纷纷从阳台上往她身上抛花儿。	0
785	So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
786	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
787	年轻的国王打量着他。	7
788	He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'	8
789	For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.	1
790	尽管今天是我的加冕典礼，可我不会用它们的。	8
791	Romance is a thing of the past."	1
792	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
793	红雀儿回答说：“你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
794	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	3
795	他们在地上挖深坑，走了进去。	8
796	I remember myself once--But it is no matter now. 	8
797	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
798	Why, you don't even know him, growled the Roman Candle.	5
799	“你们怎么知道的？”刻板的校长发问道，“你们又从来没见过天使什么样 子。	5
800	In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.	4
801	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我会给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	7
802	”他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
803	它们是用珍贵的蓝宝石做的，是一千年前从印度买来的蓝宝石呢。	6
804	他真心为他过去的行为感到后悔。	1
805	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
806	After the banquet there was to be a Ball.	7
807	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
808	You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'	7
809	His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire, but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.	7
810	'Well, for my own part,' said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, 'I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.	4
811	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
812	它从天边一路往下落，途中路过了许多别的星星；他们惊奇地看着它下落，他们好像看见它落在离小羊圈不远一簇柳树后面了。	6
813	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
814	这绝唱随着河流的浪头漂去，把它的余音一直传向大海。	7
815	苦难在一大早就把我们弄醒，耻辱夜里和我们坐在一起。	1
816	爆竹嘣嘣地回应着，快活得无以言表。	0
817	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
818	'Nay,' said the Star–Child, 'but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.'	5
819	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
820	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？”	2
821	Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.	6
822	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
823	放学后，他们只好绕着那圈高墙转悠，谈论着墙里那美丽的花园。	1
824	“星星有多美啊，”他对她说，“爱情的力量又是多么美妙啊！ ”	0
825	凡是陪他去留给他使用的那套房间的人，都经常提到他一看见为他准备的精美衣服和大量珠宝快活得脱口惊叫；提到他脱掉他那身粗糙的皮束，腰外衣和破旧的羊皮长袍时欣喜若狂的样子。	6
826	“一个家有了铁石心肠，还能不总刮来冷风吗？”他问道。	5
827	可是星孩说：“不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
828	She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.	7
829	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
830	随后小爆筒到处飞舞，信号焰火把一切染得火红。	0
831	If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.	7
832	所谓同情就是这么回事。	4
833	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
834	太阳西下时，他坐在地上哭起来，可就在哭泣时，他从陷阱里救上来的小兔子来到了他的跟前。小兔子跟他说：“你哭什么？	1
835	他可以把蓝宝石卖给珠宝商，买回些食物和柴火，把他的剧本写完了。”	0
836	这就是他的求婚活动，整整持续了一个夏天。	7
837	星孩走出了城门，来到了魔术师告诉他的那片树林旁边。	8
838	他急匆匆穿过草地，来到了那孩子身边。	7
839	What did he see?	6
840	可他母亲只能给他白开水喝，于是他就委屈得哭啊哭啊。	1
841	多么遗憾啊！”	1
842	到处都是刺鼻难闻的气味。	5
843	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
844	Ungrateful! said the girl.	6
845	“你当时在他身上发现什么标志没有？”她大声问道，	8
846	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
847	那麻风病人也把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。”	7
848	'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire, 'very thoughtful indeed.	0
849	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	4
850	“我在说，”火箭接着说，“我在说---我在说什么来着？”	7
851	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
852	你今天晚上会听见我们合唱俱乐部的演唱。	7
853	For a red rose? they cried, "how very ridiculous!" and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.	5
854	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.	2
855	“他一定天生就具有真正的浪漫气质，”转轮焰火说，“因为这时候就根本没有他流泪的理由呀她深深叹息了一声，又寻思那个松木盒子。	0
856	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	0
857	王子有一双朦胧的紫罗兰色眼睛，头发像纯金般金黄。	4
858	“我的玫瑰是红色的，”玫瑰树回答说，“红得像鸽子的爪子，甚至比海洋深洞里的珊瑚大扇叶还要红。	0
859	Nay, but it is a Star–Child,' he answered, and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.	0
860	“这世界的确非常美丽，一个小爆筒大声说，	0
861	So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.	7
862	“再见了，亲爰的王子！”他小声说，“你能让我亲亲你的手吗？ ”	7
863	I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.	7
864	“她说过，如果我给她带红玫瑰来，她就和我跳舞。”年轻的大学生嚷嚷说,“可是我的花园里哪儿也没有红玫瑰啊。”	0
865	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
866	因为我不认自己的母亲,把她赶走，傲慢无礼，对她冷酷无情。	5
867	他们把柴火堆成了堆，火箭放在了最上面，然后点上了火。	8
868	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	0
869	这一时期，许多有意思的故事都是讲述他的。	7
870	Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.	7
871	'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	0
872	她的脸色苍白异常，她坐着雪橇穿过街心时，所有的人都暗暗惊奇。	6
873	月亮升上天空时，他飞回到快乐王子身边。	0
874	他飞过卖火柴的小女孩儿身旁，他把蓝宝石放在了她的手掌上。	0
875	但是，火大没湿柴，他终于被点燃了。	7
876	But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.	6
877	“多么可爱的一小块玻璃啊！”小姑娘惊叫道,随后她一路笑着跑回家去了。	6
878	你赶快出发吧，太阳快下山时我会在花园门口等你的。	7
879	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
880	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
881	“如果你想要一朵红玫瑰，”玫瑰树说，“你必须在月光下用音乐来孕育一朵啊，还必须用你自己的心血来染红它。	4
882	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
883	第二天，他走进土牢对星孩皱起眉头，说：“在这邪教徒城门附近一个树林里，放着三块金子。	5
884	“你说过，如果我给你帯一朵红玫瑰来，你会陪我跳舞，”大学生喊道，	7
885	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
886	Well, after all there is nothing like mud.	8
887	我经常自己滔滔不绝地说个没完，而且我这人学问太大了,我说的话有时连我自己也搞不懂。”	0
888	“你原来一直在跟我调情啊。”他大声说，	6
889	第二天，一帮干活儿的人来打扫场地。	7
890	Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.	6
891	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
892	“这才是重要的事情。”	8
893	他们都极讲实际，一旦反对什么，一概称之为蒙人。	4
894	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
895	巨人悄悄地站在他身后，轻轻地把他拿在手里，放在了树上。	4
896	It is your garden now, little children, said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. 	7
897	'Little Hans, Doctor.'	6
898	王子和公主从此再没有幸福可言，他们的婚姻生活全都蒙上了阴影,至于国王，我知道他简直过不了这关。	1
899	“你愿意和我走吗？”他最后和她说,可是芦苇摇了摇头，她恋家恋得难以割舍啊。	7
900	回响带着这绝唱萦绕在山间的紫色洞穴,惊醒了梦中的牧羊人,	6
901	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	0
902	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	0
903	But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.	6
904	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
905	过了一会儿，一只大白鸭朝这儿游了过来。	6
906	然而，圣栎树听明白了，觉得好难过,因他很喜欢这只在他的枝杈上筑窝的小夜莺。	1
907	他只要开口说话就先咳嗽起来，把别人的注意力吸引过来。	7
908	瞧瞧你们还笑，找快活，仿佛王子和公主根本没有结婚似的。	7
909	他的双翼是火焰色的，他的身体像火焰一样有色彩。	0
910	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
911	一点儿不假，他对美崇拜有加，对弱者和生病的人一概嘲弄,极尽挖苦之能事。	5
912	为一个暴君干活儿固然苦，可是干活儿找不到主子更苦啊。	3
913	老主教看见他身穿牧羊装进来，从教座上惊讶地站起来，赶过去迎住他，对他说：“孩子啊，这就是国王的行头吗？我用什么皇冠来给你加冕？我拿什么权杖递交你手中？今天一定是你的欢乐日，一定不该是你的屈辱日吧。”	6
914	这时有---个人偶然瞧见了他。	6
915	“哎！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，“我只有这双眼睛了。	1
916	她的歌儿越来越细弱，她觉得有什么东西堵住了她的喉咙。	3
917	我怎么能知道呢？”	8
918	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
919	So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.	1
920	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
921	Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.	6
922	他看见星孩来了，赶紧敲响一个木碗，揺起他的铃，向他呼求，说：“给我一点儿钱吧，要不我就饿死了。	1
923	事实上，你应该学习我的榜样。你能有我这样的榜样真是算你走运。	6
924	我不是你的儿子，用不着听你说三道四。”	2
925	那是一片荒凉的墓地，位于城外。	3
926	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	3
927	贫穷从我们不见阳光的小巷溜进来，瞪着饥饿的眼睛；罪恶面无表情地接踵而来。	3
928	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
929	他还没有张开翅膀，第三滴水又掉了下来，他抬头一看，只见——唔！天哪, 他看见了什么？	6
930	他对红雀儿说：“你能在高高的树梢上飞来飞去，能看见全世界。	7
931	'The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,' she murmured, 'but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.	7
932	And the Star–Child frowned and said to himself, 'What is this that they say to me?	6
933	Therefore weep no more but be glad.'	0
934	我对你别无所求，只求你做一个痴心情郎，因为爱情远比哲学更智慧------虽然哲学就够智慧了,比权力更强大---虽然权力就够强大了。	4
935	在一个岩洞深处，死亡和贪婪注视着人群，死亡说：“我累了；三分之一的人给我，让我走吧。“	3
936	恐怕是没有。	5
937	等他回到魔术师家时，魔术师给他打开门，让他进来，对他说：“你把那块黄金带来了吗？”	7
938	“哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	1
939	一个美丽的姑娘和她的情人儿来到外面的阳台上。	7
940	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
941	Tell it to me, said the Nightingale, "I am not afraid."	4
942	“国王的花园算不上世界,你这傻爆筒，”一个大焰火筒说，“世界是一个大得不能再大的地方，你花上三天时间把它看遍就不错了。	2
943	很快他又进入了梦乡，做了这样一个梦:	8
944	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。”	3
945	他们像蚂蚁一样集聚在岩岸边。	5
946	他不准许任何人虐待鸟儿和野兽，而是教人懂得爱、亲情和仁慈；他向穷人发放面包，向衣不蔽体的人发放衣服，在他的国土上，到处一片祥和富足的景象。	4
947	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
948	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, 'Why art thou watching me?	2
949	瞧你只是个叫花子，丑陋不堪，穿得破破烂烂。	5
950	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
951	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
952	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
953	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,' and they drave him out of the garden.	2
954	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.	0
955	No, answered the Linnet, "I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.	0
956	“负情！”那姑娘说，	5
957	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
958	I hope not, said the Frog complacently.	7
959	But none of you have any hearts.	5
960	然而等他来到树林外围，他听见灌木丛里传来一声痛苦的尖叫。	3
961	'And what signs didst thou find with him?' she cried.	7
962	“为什么呢？真是的。”一只在一束阳光下飞舞的蝴蝶附和说。	6
963	And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.	7
964	他身后继位的人却以恶治国。	3
965	“你是谁呢？ ”他问道。	7
966	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	0
967	兔子回答他说：“你确实给我自由了，可我拿什么报答你呢？”	7
968	尼罗河没有泛滥，祭士们都在诅咒伊西斯回和奥西里斯図。	1
969	“我这下住进黄金屋了。”他四下打量一番，悄悄跟自己说，然后准备睡觉,可是他正要把脑袋伸进翅膀下时，一大滴水落在了他的身上。	0
970	他走进了房间，躺在他的小地铺上，开始思念他的情人儿,过了一会儿，他睡着了。	7
971	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
972	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受	1
973	“我们的老板！”织工恶狠狠地大声说，	2
974	I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.'	7
975	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.'	2
976	星孩回答他们说：“我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
977	“我们真得发表一份告示，禁止鸟类死在这里。”	7
978	真的，早些时候我在一次会议上当过主席,我们通过了一项项决议，谴责一切我们不喜欢的东西。	4
979	'They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, 'and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
980	'Alas! my son,' she cried, 'wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
981	身姿优雅，高高的白色百合纷纷从窗户往里窥视，观看他们跳舞,而硕大的红芙蓉摇头晃脑，打着节拍。	6
982	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
983	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
984	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
985	I had thoughts of entering public life once myself, remarked the Duck; "there are so many things that need reforming.	4
986	星孩回答说：“我在寻找一块藏在这里的黄金，我要是找不到它，我的主人会打我，把我当奴隶使唤的。”	1
987	And when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.	7
988	Well, well, said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, "everybody has different tastes.	8
989	指望别人像自己一样非凡，这显然是不公道的。	5
990	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	4
991	The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.	1
992	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
993	他们一脸饥饿相，瘦弱的手哆嗦个不停。	1
994	And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.	6
995	樵夫把她弄进自己家里，他老婆照料着她，等她从晕厥中醒过来，他们夫妇赶紧又给她吃又给她喝，让她安心呆着。	8
996	I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled.	4
997	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
998	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
999	那是十年前的今天吗？”	6
1000	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
1001	他说话的声音非常缓慢,但很清晰，仿佛在口授研究报告，他总是俯视着他的说话对象。	4
1002	And the Squirrel answered, 'Thou hast slain mine.	1
1003	He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.	1
1004	她看见时便飞了过去，落在一根小花枝上。	7
1005	只有那个小男孩儿没有跑掉，因为他的眼睛里满是泪水，没有看见巨人走了过来。	1
1006	I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion, said the Rocket; "no doubt that is what it means," and he looked more supercilious than ever.	5
1007	In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.	7
1008	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, "I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
1009	For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.	8
1010	那位香客回答说：“看看这面镜子,你会看见他的。“	7
1011	他于是把他的三个梦讲了出来。	8
1012	'Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?' he asked.	8
1013	You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads, she kept saying to them, and every now and then she showed them how it was done.	6
1014	花园周围修筑了很高很高的墙，可是我对高墙外是什么景象漠不关心，我身边的一切都非常美妙，无可挑剔啊。	8
1015	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
1016	这时樵夫的小女儿走到他身边，把手搭在他肩上，说：“即使你真的失去了你的美貌，那又有什么关系呢？	4
1017	He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.	8
1018	She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses, cried the young Student, "but in all my garden there is no red rose."	7
1019	I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.	5
1020	突然间，他惊讶得直揉眼睛，看了又看。	6
1021	他只有再往王子肩膀上飞一次的力气了。	8
1022	“我什么也不会给你贪婪说着,把手藏进她衣服的褶子里了。	3
1023	他身边有六名助手，每个助手用一根长竿子举着一支点燃的火炬。	6
1024	只要我们一岀场,我们就会引起人们的极大注意。	8
1025	就算它们是真的爆竹，那也不会比这看上去好看。	0
1026	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
1027	Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.	7
1028	“是的，”那人回答说，“可这位富兄弟的名字是该隐。”	8
1029	四壁都挂着代表“美神胜利”的悬垂物，	8
1030	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
1031	But the girl frowned.	5
1032	'How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, 'really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
1033	树间到处是猿和孔雀。	0
1034	有些人用大斧头劈开岩石；另一些人在沙滩匍匐前行。	8
1035	In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.	8
1036	It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.	4
1037	My roses are red, it answered, "as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.	0
1038	不过我不计较你的无知。	4
1039	于是，他回到他的屋子，抽出一本积了灰尘的大厚书，开始读起来。	7
1040	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
1041	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
1042	“你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
1043	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	2
1044	'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.	7
1045	'Follow me,' cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.	7
1046	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	2
1047	“我担心它和我的衣服不配，”她答道，“再说，宫廷大臣的侄子送给我一些真珠宝，谁都知道珠宝要比花草贵重得多呀。”	5
1048	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我来给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	0
1049	他又抽泣起来，说：“母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
1050	他确实备受仰慕。	4
1051	One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.	6
1052	随后他剩下的只有棍子了,棍子落在了正在水沟旁溜达的鹅的背上。	0
1053	太阳落山时他只好朝家的方向走去，哭得伤心极了，因为他知道什么命运在等着他。	1
1054	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	4
1055	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
1056	事实上，他误以为我是宫廷的一位权贵呢!”	0
1057	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, 'I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.	0
1058	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“你愿意和我呆上一个夜晚，给我当当送信人吗？	7
1059	“她不懂得跟人说话，”他说，“我担心她就是一个轻佻女子，看她风一来就摇晃的轻浮样儿。"	5
1060	“可是你们的小伙伴哪里去了？”他问道，“就是我抱上树的那个小男孩儿。”	7
1061	And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'	1
1062	你是老几，竟敢给上帝的世界带来痛苦？	2
1063	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
1064	但是星孩听不进去他们的话，皱起眉头一副不屑一顾的样子，他跑回同伴中间,带领他们玩耍。	5
1065	第二天一整天他都落在王子的肩膀上，跟王子讲他在异国他乡经历的事情。	0
1066	燕子自己思忖道，“他可真是彬彬有礼，连说说个人意见都细声软语的。”	4
1067	然后是盛大的国宴，持续了五个小时。	0
1068	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	0
1069	And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.	6
1070	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。	1
1071	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
1072	And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.	4
1073	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
1074	红宝石会比红玫瑰还红，蓝宝石会比大海还蓝。”	7
1075	天气冷得岀奇，连动物和鸟儿都不知道怎样对付下去了。	3
1076	的确，这天夜里他躺在奢侈的御榻上，注视着壁炉里正在熊熊燃烧的大松木圆木，脑子里转悠的就是这个。	7
1077	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	0
1078	从前，两个穷樵夫在一片广袤的松权寸林里寻路回家。	8
1079	But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, 'Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill–favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.	5
1080	的确，他只懂两种调子，却又从来弄不清楚他正在吹奏哪一种,但是这丝毫没有关系，因为不管他吹奏成什么样子，谁都得大声喝彩	0
1081	“我可以爱你吗？”燕子问道，他喜欢单刀直入，有话直说。芦苇听了深深点了一下头。	7
1082	埃及设防的城市里也流行饥荒，蝗虫是从大荒漠里出来的。	1
1083	她最初唱的是爱情在少男和少女的心扉萌生。	0
1084	So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.	8
1085	 I shall never get over it."	1
1086	Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.	8
1087	实际上我发现这地儿相当单调乏味。	8
1088	这样，在国王花园的一端搭起了一个大架子，皇家焰火匠将一切安排停当后,焰火们马上交谈起来。	7
1089	“我要去'死神殿'了。	3
1090	小燕子于是围着芦苇飞啊，飞啊，用翅膀轻轻触动水面，激起一圈圈银色的涟漪。	0
1091	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
1092	玫瑰树顶端花枝上的那朵玫瑰花哟，开得仿佛一面银镜里的玫瑰花影,又好像水池里一朵玫瑰的倒影。	0
1093	How fortunate it is for the King's son, he remarked, "that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.	7
1094	“我就住那儿去吧。”他叫道，“那是个好去处，新鲜空气有的是。”	0
1095	And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut–tree to rest.	8
1096	只有一件事情伴随终生，那就是念念不忘别人谁都有远不如人的一面，我一辈子都在培养这种感觉。	4
1097	Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.	7
1098	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“在这城市的远处，我看见一个年轻人住在阁子间。	6
1099	两个樵夫向前走啊走啊，拼命往他们的手上哈气，并在雪块儿上使劲跺他们的粗铁钉大皮靴。	8
1100	This is evidently a deputation, said the Rocket; "I will receive them with becoming dignity" so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.	8
1101	He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.	3
1102	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
1103	别为了你的快乐去捕捉它们。	8
1104	宫廷大臣对年轻的国王说：“陛下,我恳求你把你这些不吉利的念头统统打消掉，快把这件漂亮的皇袍穿上，把这顶皇冠戴在头上吧。	7
1105	“回来！快回来！”火箭尖声叫道,“我还有许多话要跟你说呢。”但是鸭子没有理睬他。	0
1106	“给我一粒吧，”死亡说，“我把它种在花园里；只要一颗，我马上就走。”	7
1107	在高高的城市上空，一根顶天立地的柱子上站立着快乐王子的塑像。	0
1108	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
1109	随后，秋天来了，他们都飞走了。	1
1110	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
1111	So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.	8
1112	“我自己也曾经想介入公共生活，”鸭子说，“需要改革的事情多不胜举。	0
1113	“你们在这里干什么？”他喊叫道,声音很霸道，孩子们赶紧跑散了。	2
1114	And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'	0
1115	But where is your little companion? he said: "the boy I put into the tree."	7
1116	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, 'Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	1
1117	我怎么能飞起来呢？	8
1118	She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.	4
1119	'Lots of people act well,' answered the Miller, 'but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also', and he	0
1120	“我原来以为有些人生来就有帝王相呢，”他回答说，“不过也许你说的有道理。	7
1121	He is too selfish, she said.	5
1122	他脖子上挂着一条链子，上面坠着一块浅绿色宝石，他的手干枯得像黄枯的树叶。	8
1123	The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.	5
1124	你能对买主说：'你要可劲儿买啊！'又对卖主说:'你要卖这个价钱？'我想不会吧。	8
1125	“不！ ”孩子回答说，“这是爱的伤痕呀。”	4
1126	How selfish I have been! he said; "now I know why the Spring would not come here.	5
1127	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
1128	But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want."	4
1129	Why, what a wonderful piece of luck! he cried, "here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.	7
1130	你就快快离开这里吧，别再让我看见你这张难看的脸“	2
1131	这时候城门旁正坐着一个麻风病人。	8
1132	But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.	7
1133	“是一个像我自己一样的人。	4
1134	“我一直表现得多么自私啊！"他说，现在我明白了为什么舂天不到这里来了。	5
1135	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
1136	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说：“快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
1137	That is what is called sympathy.	4
1138	星孩把他们领到哪里，他们就跟到哪里，星孩叫他们干什么，他们就干什么。	7
1139	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
1140	“这世上有人活得很幸福，我深感欣 慰哪。”一个失望的人打量着这尊奇妙的 塑像，喃喃自语道。	0
1141	And he certainly did explode.	6
1142	“这是因为你干了一件好事啊。”王子说。	4
1143	但是那个巨人深爱的小男孩儿再也没有露面。	1
1144	“跟我来吧。”兔子大声招呼说。随后穿过树林，来到一个水塘边。	4
1145	Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding, and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again, and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.	3
1146	空气又污浊又沉闷，墙壁湿气淋淋,淌着水流。	5
1147	He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.	7
1148	阁楼屋顶有窟窿，	8
1149	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
1150	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
1151	这里既没、非凡的火箭有社交活动，又没有安静去处。	8
1152	And one of them said to the other: 'This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?	5
1153	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	1
1154	你在这树林里找什么呢?”	6
1155	Let the fireworks begin, said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.	7
1156	I am not laughing.	8
1157	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
1158	可是，我一点儿也不在乎。	5
1159	“不必多提，毕竟是你首先心疼我的呀。”兔子说，它转眼就跑走了。	4
1160	新娘是一位俄罗斯公主，坐着六只驯鹿拉的雪橇从芬兰一路赶来了。	6
1161	他告诉王子尼罗河岸边站立的一排朱鹭,他们用大长嘴逮鱼吃,他告诉王子像这个世界一样古老的斯芬克生活在大沙漠里，天下的事情无所不知,他告诉王子牵着骆驼慢悠悠行走的商人，手里拿着一串串琥珀珠子,他告诉王子月亮山的国王,皮肤黑得像乌木，对一块大水晶石顶礼膜拜,他告诉王子在棕欄树上睡觉的大绿蛇,二十个僧侣用蜂蜜饼喂它,他告诉王子乘着大扁叶子在大湖上泛舟戏耍的小仙人,动不动就跟蝴蝶打仗。	7
1162	死神是睡眠的好兄弟,不对吗？”	4
1163	In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.	0
1164	不管怎样，我都希望你在这里定居下来。”	7
1165	There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.	0
1166	他等新娘等了整整一年，新娘终于到来了。	7
1167	你母亲没有住在这个城里。”	1
1168	And when he saw the Star–Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, 'Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.	7
1169	“焰火就像北极光，”国王说,他惯爱抢答问别人的问题。“只是更普通一点。“	6
1170	啄出我的另一眼睛，快去送给她，那样她父亲就不会打她了。”	4
1171	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
1172	For I see none here but this vile beggar–woman.'	1
1173	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
1174	你能阻止这些事情发生吗？你愿意和麻风病人同床共寝吗？愿意和乞丐同桌共餐吗？狮子会按你说的做吗？野猪会听从你的命令吗？造成人间苦难的他不比你更精明吗？	3
1175	Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.	6
1176	这全世界再没有比我这人敏感的了，我对此深信不疑。	4
1177	你不是我们当中的一员。	8
1178	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
1179	实际上，我要高高地飞到------”	7
1180	所以,放我走吧，我一定要再一次走遍全世界,尽管你们给我拿来这皇冠和权杖,可我不能久留此地啊。”	7
1181	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
1182	Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. 	6
1183	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	0
1184	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
1185	“我就只要一呆红玫瑰，”夜莺尖声叫道，“只要一朵红玫瑰啊！我真就没办法弄到一朵吗?"	7
1186	The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. 	2
1187	His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.	0
1188	I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.	5
1189	The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.	4
1190	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
1191	起码可以说这是个暗地里流传的故事。	8
1192	Oh! dear no, cried the Rocket.	6
1193	Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.	5
1194	然后他飞回来，跟王子讲了他的见闻。	7
1195	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
1196	他于是揭开斗篷，让老婆看那熟睡的孩子。	8
1197	他们俩有一个比同伴跑得快，抢先从柳树中穿过去，从另一边跑岀来，瞧！白雪里真的有一样金玩意儿。	6
1198	So the Hail came. 	8
1199	奴隶们都趴在桨上睡着了。	8
1200	“音乐家们会在他们的乐池里就座，”年轻的大学生说，“弹奏他们的乐器，我的情人儿会随着竖琴和小提琴的乐曲翩翩起舞。她会跳得脚下生风，连地都不沾，那些献殷勤的人穿戴得漂漂亮亮,纷纷围着她打转转。	0
1201	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
1202	“多么奇怪的现象，”鸟类学教授走过桥时说，	6
1203	那个老神父也经常找他去，尽心尽力教他热爱有生命的东西，并对他说：“蝇子是你的兄弟。	4
1204	那女人没有理他,只是向炉火边靠近。	8
1205	我们和那些辛辛苦苦为我们劳作的人有什么关系？一个人非得亲眼看见播种的人才可以吃面包吗？一个人非得和踩榨葡萄酒的人交谈过才可以喝葡萄酒吗？”	2
1206	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
1207	一些别的奴隶从船舷好奇地探视着。	6
1208	他飞过河的上空，看见灯笼挂在船的桅杆上。	8
1209	当然，他们永远别想砸到我,我们燕子飞得快着呢，躲躲石头是小事一桩,再说啦，谁都知道我们家的人身手矫捷,不过话说回来，用石头砍人总是不光彩的。	8
1210	我跟他们谈论漂亮的新娘时，你们会看见他们在不停地眨眼睛。”	7
1211	这是我的一大乐趣。	0
1212	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？”	4
1213	“不死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
1214	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
1215	I don't think much of that, said the Duck, "as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
1216	我这件皇袍是悲伤的织机织的，是痛苦的苍白的手织的。	1
1217	Hallo! cried one of the boys, "look at this old stick! I wonder how it came here"; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.	6
1218	“谢谢你，小燕子。”王子说。	4
1219	但是他对老婆说：“我在树林里拾到一样东西，就给你带来了，让你照管他站在门边没有进来。	7
1220	但是谁都不敢看他的脸，只因他的脸像天使的圣容。	4
1221	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
1222	一块是白金，一块是黄金，第三块金子是红色的。	8
1223	夜莺于是飞到了生长在古老的日晷旁的那棵玫瑰树上。	6
1224	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	0
1225	“你好冷酷，”她惊叫道，	3
1226	你今晚要把它别在你的心口旁，我们一起跳舞时，它会告诉你我是多么爱你。”	7
1227	Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.	1
1228	他在所有事情上都左右着他们，他们都变得铁石心肠，和他完全一样。	5
1229	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
1230	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
1231	It took him the whole day to get there and back, and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.	0
1232	“什么是敏感的人？”爆竹问焰火筒说。	6
1233	实际上是你应该多想想我。	4
1234	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
1235	“我承认她是个固守闺房，”燕子继续说，“可我喜爱到处走走，夫唱妇随，我的妻子也应该喜爱到处旅游才是。”	5
1236	我可是宫廷的大宠儿,实际上，王子和公主昨天就是冲我的面子才举行婚礼的。	0
1237	可是士兵们嘲笑他，其中一个甩着黑胡子，放下手里的盾，大声说：“说真的，你的母亲见了你也不会感到快乐，因为你这副样子比沼泽地的癞蛤蟆还令人恶心，比水草地里乱爬的蛭蛇还令人害怕。	5
1238	Get thee gone.	2
1239	不过，也得承认，她的声音有时听上去很美。	0
1240	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
1241	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
1242	他飞过犹太居民区，看见那些上年纪的犹太人在互相讨价还价，用铜秤称钱。	8
1243	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
1244	大白鸭长着两条黄腿，带蹉的爪子,就因为她走路摇摇摆摆，被认为是大美人儿一个。	0
1245	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
1246	“瞧，快瞧！”玫瑰树招呼说，“这朵玫瑰终于培育成了。”但是夜莺没有回答，因为她躺在深草丛中，死了，心上带着那根刺儿。	0
1247	于是，他就落在了快乐王子的两脚之间。	6
1248	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
1249	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
1250	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?'	8
1251	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
1252	And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.	3
1253	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
1254	'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	0
1255	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
1256	她不会为了别人牺牲自己。	5
1257	他们搂住他的脖子亲吻他，把他带进了宫殿,给他穿上漂亮的衣服，把皇冠戴上他的头，把权杖放入他手中，他于是统治了这个临河的城市，成为一城之主。	6
1258	雪橇的样子像一只金色大天鹅，这位纤巧的公主本人坐在天鹅的翅膀中间。	0
1259	我的两只脚固定在这底座上了，我不能动啊。”	1
1260	And he answered, 'My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.'	7
1261	然而，他的美反使他不学好只学坏。	6
1262	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	1
1263	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
1264	最后他们到达一小海湾，开始测水深。	7
1265	“为什么呢？真是的。”一朵菊花也跟自己的邻居悄声细语地说。	6
1266	At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.	7
1267	他也打听不到他母亲也就是那个要饭女人的一点消息，尽管他在世界上寻找了三年，也往往好像看见她就在前面的路上走，便呼喊她,在她身后紧追不舍，尖利的石片把他的脚割得血淋淋的。	3
1268	'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day.	1
1269	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	1
1270	Is the story about me? asked the Water-rat.	0
1271	但是孩子们一看见他，吓得胆战心惊，纷纷逃跑了,花园又变成了冬天。	3
1272	芦苇一贯喜欢下雨, 可那完全是为了她自己。”	0
1273	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
1274	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
1275	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
1276	“我的玫瑰是白色的，”玫瑰树回答道，“白得像海浪的泡沫，甚至比山头的冰雪还要洁白。	0
1277	兔子跟他说：“你找的那块红金子就在你身后的那个岩洞里。	4
1278	What a curious shape you are!	6
1279	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	0
1280	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
1281	It is applicable to you, answered the Linnet, and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.	6
1282	于是星孩跟着兔子去了，瞧！在一棵老橡树的裂缝里，他看见了他正在寻找的那块白金。	6
1283	于是他悄悄走下楼梯，蹑手蹑脚地打开前门，走出房子，进了花园。	3
1284	What are fireworks like? she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.	7
1285	Why! 	6
1286	And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of white gold?'	7
1287	But the Tree shook its head.	1
1288	一点不假，他有时会怀念起他在森林中无拘无束的生活，会又寸每天占去许多时间的宫廷繁礼缠节动辄大发脾气，但这令人入迷的宫殿--如人称所谓的“欢乐宫”------似乎是他寻欢觅乐的全新世界,他发现自己成了宫中的君王。	7
1289	但是，快乐王子看上去难过极了，小燕子觉得很过意不去。	7
1290	Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; "but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.	1
1291	他不管遇到什么都会打听打听，是不是看见了他的母亲。	7
1292	Once upon a time, said the Linnet, "there was an honest little fellow named Hans."	0
1293	桌子上放着一只扁平的紫晶盒。	8
1294	“我看他们是要留着我派什么大用场吧，”火箭说，“肯定就是这么回事他于是摆出一副更加目空一切的样子。	7
1295	宫殿的门开了，神父们和城里的大臣纷纷跑来迎候他，在他面前阿谀奉承，说:“你就是我们一直久候的君主，我们国王的骄子啊。”	7
1296	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
1297	You had really better keep yourself dry, said the Fire-balloon.	4
1298	你肚子里什么都没有，整个儿一个草包。	5
1299	玫瑰树顶端的花枝绽开了一朵奇异的玫瑰花，花瓣儿连着花瓣儿，就像歌儿连着歌儿。	6
1300	真的，事先要，非凡的火箭是早有安排，那到头来对他倒不见得有多好,不过王孙公子总是吉星高照啊！”	7
1301	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: 'Wilt thou not close the door?	3
1302	“哑火箭？哑火箭？”他在空中打着转儿自问道，“不可能！'大火箭，'这才该是刚才那个人说的话。	7
1303	事实上，只是在昨天我才听见农夫妻子跟她母亲说，因为我们唱歌她一夜都没有合眼。	0
1304	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
1305	于是，燕子啄起王子剑柄上的那颗大红宝石，用嘴衔着飞过了城市屋顶的上空。	6
1306	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
1307	不一会儿，月亮升起来了，宛如美丽的银盾,星星一片灿烂，宫里传岀了悦耳的音乐。	7
1308	'All right!' said the Doctor, and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.	7
1309	“真是奇怪，”他说，“天气虽然这么冷，我现在却觉得身上热乎乎的。”	0
1310	“早死净了。”转轮焰火念叨说，睡了过去。	1
1311	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
1312	可是我的花园里没有红玫瑰,那我只好孤零零坐在那里，眼睁睁看她从我身边走过去。	1
1313	这个老头儿实际上是利比亚最眼疾手快的魔术师，他从一个在尼罗河古墓中栖身的大师那里获得了真传。	8
1314	你真的还是不哭为好，”流星火花说，	0
1315	野猪在山谷里拱吃玉米的根，狐狸咬断山间的葡萄藤。	3
1316	“高兴起来吧，”夜莺尖声说，“高兴起来吧,你会得到你的红玫瑰的。	0
1317	But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
1318	Give me a red rose, she cried, "and I will sing you my sweetest song."	7
1319	What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good."	5
1320	'What do you want, little Hans?'	7
1321	因为在这孩子的手掌上有两个指甲印子，他的小脚丫上也有两个指甲印子。	8
1322	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
1323	星孩又进了树林，搜寻了一天那块红金子，但到处找也找不到。	7
1324	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.'	1
1325	老头儿从缠头布上取下一块花绸布，蒙在星孩的眼睛上，推操着往前面走。	3
1326	随后十点钟敲响了，然后是---点,然后是十二点，午夜钟声敲完最后一下时,每个人都走出房子，来到阳台，国王命人去叫皇家焰火匠。	7
1327	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	0
1328	然而贪婪攥紧手，咬紧牙关。	4
1329	How I would like to see him! he used to say.	7
1330	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
1331	“那你真应该去教授哲学，“蜻蜓说，他展开一对活泼可爱的纱一样的翅膀,飞向天空。	6
1332	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
1333	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
1334	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
1335	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
1336	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
1337	我称你这种行为是自私，而自私是顶顶讨厌的玩意儿，尤其我这种脾气受不了，因我生来就富有同情心，谁都知道的。	4
1338	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, "but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
1339	And the woman answered him, 'I am thy mother.'	0
1340	He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.	5
1341	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
1342	两只苍鹭在船周围飞来飞去。	3
1343	他抽搐了一阵儿，接着就一动不动了。	3
1344	“你当然难受了！”信号焰火叫道,	1
1345	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
1346	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
1347	“你怎么一点儿都不像快乐王子 呢？” 一位明白事理的母亲对着自己无理哭闹的小孩儿说，	4
1348	Boom! Boom! went the Roman Candle.	6
1349	他跑进家门，既惊奇又惊喜。	6
1350	But they have not lost their only son, said the Roman Candle; "no misfortune has happened to them at all."	6
1351	幸亏本人我不在乎。	0
1352	嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他径直飞向了天。	0
1353	那年轻的大学生还躺在草地上，和她飞走时看见的一样，他那双美丽的眼睛里的泪水还没干呢。	1
1354	“得了，你根本就不认识他焰火筒嗷嗷回击说。	5
1355	Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.'	8
1356	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
1357	I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'	7
1358	I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.	8
1359	但是她并没有消气，反而取笑他，越说气越大，最后哭泣道：“我们的孩子都没有面包吃，我们还养得起别人的孩子吗？	2
1360	巨人对所有孩子都非常和蔼，可他仍一心想念他的第一个小朋友,经常说起他。	7
1361	但是他一弄明白是谁在等他后，冷嘲热讽地笑道:“得了，我母亲在哪里呢？我只看见这个脏臭的要饭女人呀。	5
1362	你和我们有什么关系？我们受苦与你有何相干？”	5
1363	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	0
1364	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
1365	'Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'	6
1366	It may be so with you, he answered; "indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.	8
1367	From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.	6
1368	可是孩子们说他们并不知道他住在哪里，过去从来也没有见过他；巨人觉得伤心极了。	1
1369	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
1370	But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.	8
1371	“我毫不怀疑对你来说非常重要，”火箭回答说，“不过要是我愿意，我就会哭。”他还真的泪如泉涌，像雨珠儿一样顺着他的棍子往下流，差一点儿把两只小甲虫淹死,这两只小家伙正在琢磨一起修房盖屋,找一处干爽的地方躲避风雨。	4
1372	“我身上裹着赤金王子说，“你一定把它啄下来，一片一片地啄，把它送给穷人,活着的人总是以为金子能让他幸福。”	0
1373	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
1374	苍白的病恢恢的孩子们蜷缩在大梁上。	1
1375	他于是走到水井旁，往下看去，瞧呀!他的脸果真像癞蛤蟆的脸，他的身上像蛭蛇一样长满了鳞片。	3
1376	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	2
1377	他写了一封长信寄给当地报纸，谈及这件怪事。	8
1378	“一尊大塑像连一点雨都遮挡不了，它还有什么用？”他发问说，“我只好去找一个好烟囱去躲躲了。”他决定飞走算了。	2
1379	他到处寻找，却总找不到魔术师说的那块白金，找啊找啊，从早上找到中午，从中午找到夕阳西下。	1
1380	实际上，她和大多数艺术家没有什么两样,她就是花架子，不讲一点真诚。	5
1381	“他太自私了。”秋天说。	5
1382	“我身穿痛苦铸就的衣冠，能高兴起来吗？”年轻的国王说。	1
1383	“焰火是个啥样子呢？”一天早上，她问王子说，边说边在平台上走动着。	7
1384	Conversation, indeed! said the Rocket.	8
1385	哑'和'大'听声音倒是挺像的它们往往也就是一回事吧。”他掉进了泥水里。	7
1386	随后他用那块花绸巾蒙上星孩的眼睛，领着他穿过房子和罂粟花园,走上那五级铜台阶。	8
1387	一点不假，他真的是被猎人们非常偶然地发现的；当时他四肢裸露，手持笛子,跟在一群山羊后面；他是那个牧羊人一手拉扯大的，一直认为自己是牧羊人的儿子。	6
1388	'I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	1
1389	但是要饭的女人一言不发。	8
1390	I don't understand you, answered the Water-rat.	5
1391	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	0
1392	据说那个墓穴里还躺着一个人，死者是一个异常英俊美丽的青年，他的双手用绳子反绑着，胸部被捅了很多刀，衣服都被血染红了。	3
1393	“我们饿得不行了！ ”他们叹道。	3
1394	The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none.	8
1395	Quack, quack, quack, she said.	8
1396	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	0
1397	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
1398	第二天，燕子飞到了海港。	7
1399	But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?	4
1400	Then one of them caught sight of him.	8
1401	And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend? asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.	4
1402	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, 'He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
1403	当然当然,我知道一谈到有趣的话题，就准有人横加打断。	5
1404	请你现在认了你的孩子吧。”	7
1405	于是冰雹来了。	7
1406	“这位穿戴得像一个乞丐的国王在哪里------就是给我们王国带来耻辱的男孩儿？我们一定要杀了他,他根本不配统治我们。”	2
1407	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
1408	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，“不过这也不出我所料。	2
1409	He said to the Linnet, 'Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst see the whole world.	7
1410	可是玫瑰树又摇起头来。	5
1411	今天你去给我把那块白金拿来,要是你拿不来，那我准会让你挨上一百鞭子。	2
1412	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
1413	主教听了他的三个梦，眉头皱起来,说：“我的孩子，我是一个老人，已是花甲暮年，大千世界里发生过的许多恶行,我见得多了。	5
1414	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.'	4
1415	That is the new method.	7
1416	My own garden is my own garden, said the Giant; "any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself."	8
1417	我会在月光下用音乐孕育一朵,用我自己的心血把它染红。	7
1418	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
1419	Romance never dies.	7
1420	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，她就会和我一直跳到天亮。	0
1421	三个阿拉伯人骑着野毛驴出来，向他们投掷标枪。	3
1422	“他像风向标一样美丽，”一位市议员发表看法说，一心想附庸风雅，“只是不怎么有用处啊。”他找补一句说，生怕人们会认为他不讲究实 际，因为他的确是一个务实的人。	5
1423	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
1424	夜莺从她的圣栋树窝里听见他说话,从树叶间往外看，心里感到纳闷儿。	6
1425	“我自己的花园就是我自己的花园，”巨人说，“谁都明白这个理儿，我以后不让任何人来玩儿，我自己想怎么玩儿都行。”	7
1426	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
1427	印度一些设防的城市里流行饥荒，撤马尔罕的水塘耗干了。	1
1428	Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.	0
1429	中午时，黄色的狮子纷纷到河边来饮水。	8
1430	Certainly not, answered the Linnet, "that is the beginning."	7
1431	可在埃及，太阳把绿色的棕桐树照得热乎乎的，鳄鱼躲在泥里懒洋洋地打量棕梱树。	7
1432	 “我什么都不会送给你的。”贪婪说。	1
1433	巨龟在热泥中躺着睡觉。	8
1434	燕子啊，燕子啊，小燕子啊，你能把我剑柄端上的红宝石衔上送给她吗？	0
1435	“你好冷酷啊。	3
1436	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
1437	He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.	8
1438	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说,他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
1439	“天怎么下起棍子雨了？”她赶紧跳进水里去了。	3
1440	You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.	4
1441	那女人就回答他：“我是你的母亲呀。”	4
1442	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的做吧。”	6
1443	But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.	4
1444	“这颗明珠，”他说，“将镶嵌在年轻国王的权杖上。”他挥手示意黑人们起锚开船。	7
1445	“喂！”一个男孩儿叫道，“快看这根旧棍子！多奇怪，它怎么到这里来了？”他从水沟里捡起火箭。	6
1446	So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star–Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.	6
1447	Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial."	5
1448	老人往他面前的一个木盘子里放了一些发霉的面包说：“吃吧，”又往一个杯子里倒了些稍带咸味的水，说：“喝吧”。	5
1449	It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.	5
1450	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说：“这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
1451	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	0
1452	王子和公主坐在大厅的首席，喝干了一水晶杯酒。	4
1453	“别呀，”他大声说，笑起来，“我们何必不把这丑东西当奴隶卖了，他的身价还够一碗甜酒的钱吧。”	5
1454	那块黄金正在水塘的底上躺着呢。	6
1455	另一个士兵手里拿着一面黄旗，对他说：“谁是你母亲呢？你为什么寻找她？”	8
1456	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	4
1457	So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.	7
1458	他觉得他站在一间又长又矮的顶楼间，周围一片丁丁当当的织机声。	8
1459	“总得有听着的人呀，”青蛙回答说，“我这人就喜欢一个劲儿说个没完。	0
1460	于是他们把快乐王子的塑像拉倒了。	1
1461	Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean, said a Bengal Light; "I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister."	2
1462	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
1463	他身上没有包着一件绣满星星的金丝斗篷吗？	8
1464	死亡对她说：“你手里拿着什么？”	8
1465	樵夫和他老伴儿走岀家门，喊来星孩,对他说：“快到家里来，你这下找到你妈妈了，她正在等你呢。”	7
1466	What a curious thing! he cried; "there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.	6
1467	Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.'	8
1468	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
1469	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
1470	You are a very irritating person," said the Rocket, "and very illbred.	2
1471	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
1472	老头儿用戒指打开门后，把星孩领到了大街上。	8
1473	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.'	0
1474	What I sing of, he suffers--what is joy to me, to him is pain.	1
1475	这是美丽的德行，我这种德行可非一日之功。	0
1476	她捶打着她那不育的胸脯,大声哭叫起来。	2
1477	So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.	7
1478	“旧棍子！”火箭说，“不可能！金棍子，这才是他应该叫的。	0
1479	I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.	5
1480	So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.	7
1481	OLD Stick! said the Rocket, "impossible! GOLD Stick, that is what he said.	6
1482	“的确是悦耳的声音，”青蛙接着说，“我希望你也到那鸭子水塘去吧。	0
1483	谁是你的老板？〃年轻的国王问道。	7
1484	他们把我赶岀了城门，谁都不管我的死活。”	2
1485	“在远处，”塑像接着低声软语地说，	8
1486	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
1487	I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.	4
1488	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
