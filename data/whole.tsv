738	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	Joy
739	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	Sadness
740	“早死净了。”转轮焰火念叨说，睡了过去。	Sadness
741	So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	Joy
742	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	Sadness
743	“你完全是一个惹人生气的家伙，”火箭说，没有一点儿教养。	Anger
744	亲爰的王子，我必须离开你，可我永远不会忘记你，明年春天我会给你带回两颗美丽的宝石，安放在你忍痛割爱的那些地方。	Sadness
745	于是她展开她那棕色的翅膀，直冲云霄。	Joy
746	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	Joy
747	“我的玫瑰是白色的，”玫瑰树回答道，白得像海浪的泡沫，甚至比山头的冰雪还要洁白。	Joy
748	They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	Joy
749	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	Sadness
750	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	Joy
751	How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, really I feel quite drowsy. 	Joy
752	房子的一扇窗户开着，我从窗子看见一个女人坐在桌子前面。她的脸又瘦又憔悴，一双手红红的，很粗糙，被针扎 得到处是针眼儿，因为她是做针线的女工。	Sadness
753	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	Anger
754	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	Joy
755	Alas! my son,' she cried, wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	Sadness
756	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	Love
757	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	Joy
758	My roses are red, it answered, as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.	Joy
759	给我个阴雨天儿让我呆在水沟里，我就很幸福了。	Joy
760	他整夜遥望星星,晨星亮起时他就高兴得叫唤一声，然后就悄无声息了。	Joy
761	真的，《宫廷报》称赞他是焰火艺术的最好范例呢。	Joy
762	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	Anger
763	“的确是悦耳的声音，”青蛙接着说，我希望你也到那鸭子水塘去吧。	Joy
764	于是，夜莺给圣栎树唱歌儿，她的声音好像水从银壶里泻岀来那样叮咚作响。	Joy
765	可他母亲只能给他白开水喝，于是他就委屈得哭啊哭啊。	Sadness
766	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	Love
767	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	Love
768	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	Joy
769	他飞进了黑賤駿的小巷，看见挨饿的孩子面色惨白,无可奈何地望着黑乎乎的街道。	Sadness
770	白天我和我的小伙伴儿在花园里玩耍，晩上我在大厅里领头跳舞。	Joy
771	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	Joy
772	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	Joy
773	如果他们失去了他们唯一的儿子,，非凡的火箭那说什么话也枉然。	Sadness
774	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	Sadness
775	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.	Anger
776	嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他径直飞向了天。	Joy
777	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	Joy
778	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	Fear
779	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	Love
780	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我来给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	Joy
781	“胡说八道！”大焰火筒说，浪漫情调从来不死。	Anger
782	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	Anger
783	玫瑰树顶端花枝上的那朵玫瑰花哟，开得仿佛一面银镜里的玫瑰花影,又好像水池里一朵玫瑰的倒影。	Joy
784	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	Joy
785	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	Anger
786	“我毫不怀疑对你来说非常重要，”火箭回答说，“不过要是我愿意，我就会哭。”他还真的泪如泉涌，像雨珠儿一样顺着他的棍子往下流，差一点儿把两只小甲虫淹死,这两只小家伙正在琢磨一起修房盖屋,找一处干爽的地方躲避风雨。	Sadness
787	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	Joy
788	“旧棍子！”火箭说，不可能！金棍子，这才是他应该叫的。	Anger
789	And the Squirrel answered, Thou hast slain mine.	Anger
790	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	Love
791	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	Joy
792	那年轻的大学生还躺在草地上，和她飞走时看见的一样，他那双美丽的眼睛里的泪水还没干呢。	Sadness
793	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	Sadness
794	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	Fear
795	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	Joy
796	哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	Sadness
797	“一尊大塑像连一点雨都遮挡不了，它还有什么用？”他发问说，“我只好去找一个好烟囱去躲躲了。”他决定飞走算了。	Anger
798	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	Anger
799	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	Sadness
800	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	Sadness
801	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, Why art thou weeping?	Sadness
802	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	Sadness
803	Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, I am in great trouble.	Sadness
804	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	Joy
805	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	Joy
806	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	Joy
807	The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.	Joy
808	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	Sadness
809	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	Joy
810	“我们饿得不行了！ ”他们叹道。	Sadness
811	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	Love
812	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，否则你是知道我的身世的。	Anger
813	But the girl frowned.	Sadness
814	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	Sadness
815	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	Joy
816	“总得有听着的人呀，”青蛙回答说，我这人就喜欢一个劲儿说个没完。	Joy
817	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	Joy
818	My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	Joy
819	她不会钟情于我，我的心会碎的。	Sadness
820	“秩序！秩序！”一个爆竹吆喝道。	Anger
821	But the Tree shook its head.	Sadness
822	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	Sadness
823	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	Anger
824	“这世上有人活得很幸福，我深感欣慰哪。”一个失望的人打量着这尊奇妙的塑像，喃喃自语道。	Joy
825	但是谁都没有听见他引爆了，就是两个近在咫尺的小男孩儿也没有听见，因为他们睡得很香了。	Sadness
826	我的两只脚固定在这底座上了，我不能动啊。	Sadness
827	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受。	Sadness
828	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: The fly is thy brother.	Love
829	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	Sadness
830	这根本不是交谈。	Anger
831	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	Joy
832	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	Joy
833	“你是我见过的最粗鲁的人，”火箭说，“你不理解我对王子的友谊。”	Anger
834	“我们现在有面包吃了！”他们欢呼说。	Joy
835	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	Love
836	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	Joy
837	Therefore weep no more but be glad.	Joy
838	I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	Sadness
839	“我要让全世界刮目相看，兴奋一阵子,我要轰动一时，让所有的人一年之内不谈论别的事，就把我挂在嘴边。“	Joy
840	可是，她就是不和我跳舞，因为我没红玫瑰献给她，他有气无力地倒在草地上，把脸埋在两只手里,哭了。	Sadness
841	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	Love
842	I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	Sadness
843	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	Fear
844	随后，秋天来了，他们都飞走了。	Sadness
845	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	Sadness
846	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	Fear
847	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	Fear
848	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	Anger
849	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	Sadness
850	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.	Love
851	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.	Joy
852	“高兴起来吧，”夜莺尖声说，高兴起来吧,你会得到你的红玫瑰的。	Joy
853	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.	Sadness
854	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	Sadness
855	“哎！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，我只有这双眼睛了。	Sadness
856	“天怎么下起棍子雨了？”她赶紧跳进水里去了。	Fear
857	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	Anger
858	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	Fear
859	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说。	Anger
860	他们的羽毛让白霜冻得硬刷刷,但是他们一点儿也不在乎;他们滚动着他们的大黄眼睛，在森林里彼此遥相呼叫：“啯啯啯喵------啯啯!啯啯啯喵------啯啯！我们遇到了多么好的天气啊！”	Joy
861	I like hearing myself talk.	Joy
862	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	Joy
863	Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.	Joy
864	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	Anger
865	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	Sadness
866	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	Joy
867	Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.	Joy
868	就这样，星孩和樵夫的孩子一起抚养大了，同他们坐在同一张餐桌旁就餐，同他们一起玩耍。	Joy
869	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	Fear
870	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	Anger
871	“我们过得多么快乐幸福啊！ ”他们互相告慰道。	Joy
872	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	Love
873	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	Joy
874	I am very glad I have travelled.	Joy
875	“这是一个令人愉快的地方，”北风说，“我们一定要请冰雹来访冋。”	Joy
876	不公平瓜分了这世界，除了忧愁分得公平，什么东西都分得不公平。	Anger
877	但是他对他们说：我不配啊，因为我不认我的亲生母亲，在我找到她，求得她的原谅之前，我是不会心安的。	Sadness
878	这世界的负重是任何一个人都承担不了的，这世界的悲哀也是任何一颗心都承受不了的啊。	Sadness
879	因为花园里没有孩子们，鸟儿不愿意在里面唱歌，桃树也忘记开花了。	Sadness
880	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	Joy
881	你一脸幸福哪。	Joy
882	快快滚到一边。	Anger
883	The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. 	Joy
884	在花园最远的角落，一棵树开满了可爰的白花儿。	Joy
885	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	Sadness
886	可怜的孩子们这下没有地方可玩儿了。	Sadness
887	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	Anger
888	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	Fear
889	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	Love
890	星孩于是走向树林，花了整整一天时间搜寻那块黄金，但是怎么找也找不到。	Sadness
891	那是一个冬天，入夜后天冷得更厉害了。	Sadness
892	“春天把这花园遗忘了，”他们大叫着，“这下我们可以一年到头住在这里了。”	Joy
893	“可我如何报答你呢，”星孩说，“你瞧！这可是你第三次救我了啊！”	Love
894	And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.	Joy
895	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	Fear
896	务必把那块白金带来,要不你过不了这关，别忘了你是我的奴隶,我可是用一碗甜酒的价钱把你买来的。	Fear
897	商人虐待我们，我们必须对他们言听计从。	Fear
898	It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.	Joy
899	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	Fear
900	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	Sadness
901	我根本不是你的儿子。	Anger
902	The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.	Love
903	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	Joy
904	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	Sadness
905	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	Joy
906	他马上脸色惨白，说：“为哪位国王？”	Fear
907	政府为什么连管也不管呢？	Anger
908	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	Joy
909	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	Fear
910	But the Tree shook its head.	Sadness
911	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	Anger
912	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	Sadness
913	“可是人家并没有失去他们唯一的儿子,”焰火筒说，“他们根本就没遇上倒霉的事。”	Joy
914	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	Love
915	比如说,假如今天夜里我有个三长两短，这对谁来说都是一大不幸！	Sadness
916	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	Fear
917	So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.	Joy
918	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	Sadness
919	The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.	Joy
920	“我笑是因为我高兴呀。”爆竹回答说。	Joy
921	You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	Love
922	一层薄薄的红晕岀现在玫瑰的叶子里，宛如新郎初吻新娘的柔唇时脸上露出的潮红。	Love
923	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.	Anger
924	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.	Sadness
925	“这里好冷啊，”他说，“不过我会跟你呆上一个夜晚，给你当送信的人。”	Love
926	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	Sadness
927	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	Anger
928	但是冬天把我的叶脉冻坏了，霜冻摧毁了我的花蕾，暴风雨折断了我的树枝，今年我没法开玫瑰花了。	Sadness
929	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	Sadness
930	他的朋友六个星期前都飞往埃及去了，但他耽搁下来，因他和最美丽的芦苇相爱了。	Love
931	他当然是爆炸了。	Fear
932	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	Fear
933	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	Love
934	哦，再见,听我说没错，能跟你交谈我很高兴。	Joy
935	It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.	Joy
936	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	Fear
937	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	Fear
938	“这是再自私不过的理由，”火箭生气地说，	Anger
939	“尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	Love
940	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	Anger
941	朝臣这下全乐了，有人索性冲他大声喊：“陛下，人民在等待自己的国王，你却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒火顿生，说：“他为我们国家带来耻辱,不配做我们的一国之君。”	Anger
942	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	Fear
943	God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.	Love
944	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	Fear
945	“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你一定要飞往埃及去。”	Sadness
946	“谁竟敢伤害你？”巨人大声责问道，“快告诉我，看我拿上我的大剑，去把他砍了。”	Anger
947	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	Sadness
948	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'	Anger
949	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	Sadness
950	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。”	Joy
951	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	Sadness
952	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	Joy
953	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	Joy
954	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	Love
955	What a success I am!"	Joy
956	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	Fear
957	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	Love
958	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	Sadness
959	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	Love
960	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	Sadness
961	按宫廷御医说，那个生下他的白人姑娘是死于悲伤或瘟疫；而另有人则说是用一杯配制好的意大利烈性毒酒让她服下，不到一小时就活活弄死了她;那个可靠的信差，把这孩子放在鞍子前面就跑了，等他跳下疲劳的马、敲开牧羊人小屋的柴门时，公主的尸体正在往挖开的墓穴里放。	Fear
962	多么可怕的灾难！	Fear
963	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."	Joy
964	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	Sadness
965	It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.	Joy
966	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？”	Anger
967	再往远处,在一片果园里，一只夜莺在欢唱。	Joy
968	He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.	Love
969	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	Sadness
970	What a terrible misfortune! 	Fear
971	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	Sadness
972	我们今后怎么养活他呢？她生丈夫的气了。	Anger
