976	“无上荣耀呀！”全体朝臣纷纷道贺说。	0
977	“没错儿，”信号焰火大声呼应说,他这时的情绪好了些，“这可是个常识问题。”	0
978	夜莺于是越来越紧地顶在刺上，她唱得也越来越瞭亮，因为她唱的是男子和女子的灵魂里产生了激情。	0
979	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name", and he leaned down and plucked it.	6
980	She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.	2
981	多么可怕的灾难！	3
982	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
983	“因为他不再美丽，所以就不再有用了。”大学的美术教授说。	5
984	'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	3
985	那个国王自己就在那里，躺在他的油漆棺材里。	8
986	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
987	“再见了，”流星火花大声喊叫着，直冲天空，撤下一路小小的蓝色火星。	6
988	这花儿美极了，准保有一个长长的拉丁名字。”他探下身子把玫瑰花儿摘掉了。	0
989	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
990	到我的城市上空去飞一趟，小燕子，回来告诉我你在下面看见了什么。”	7
991	Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.'	7
992	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
993	Sing me one last song, he whispered, "I shall feel very lonely when you are gone."	7
994	Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand.	7
995	“天哪！”鹅大声叫道，	6
996	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
997	Then you are quite behind the age, said the Water-rat.	6
998	God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.	4
999	我上一次见到他们,他们还在争吵昵。	4
1000	The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.	6
1001	But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.'	6
1002	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
1003	这位纤弱的公主长这么大还没有看见过放焰火，因此国王早已下了圣旨，皇家焰火匠在婚礼那天到场凑趣。	6
1004	“世上还真有不折不扣的情种，”夜莺说，	6
1005	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
1006	这下我能写完我的剧本了。”他看上去相当幸福。	0
1007	夜莺唱完歌儿时，大学生站起来，从口袋里抽出笔记本和铅笔。	6
1008	'What is it?' she cried.	7
1009	As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.	7
1010	他亲吻过快乐王子的嘴唇，掉在王子脚下死去了。	1
1011	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."	0
1012	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	1
1013	One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?"	7
1014	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。”	0
1015	她没有穿鞋，没有穿袜子，还光着小脑袋。	1
1016	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	1
1017	“我从来没有说过他们赶上了倒霉的事，”火箭答道，“我只是说他们也许会有不幸。	8
1018	There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.	6
1019	“为一朵红玫瑰？”他们同声惊讶道，“真是咄咄怪事啊！”小蜥蜴是一个喜欢拿别人开心的人，忍不住哈哈笑出声来。	6
1020	“这可是世间最红的玫瑰。	0
1021	“国王的儿子真叫走运，”他说，“他结婚的那天我正好被燃放。	0
1022	我这下把风头岀尽了！”	0
1023	我讨厌那些夸夸其谈、口口声声离不开自己的人，你就这个德性,人家都还想谈谈自己呢，我就是这样。	5
1024	And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.	0
1025	旅行使人大长见识，摆脱一切偏见。	4
1026	这是毫无疑问。	8
1027	“我要去埃及！”燕子大声说，可是没有人在意，月亮升起来时，他又飞回快乐王子身边。	7
1028	Even the cattle of the field praise Him.'	0
1029	他浑身贴满了一片片赤金叶子，眼睛含着两颗晶莹的蓝宝石，佩剑的剑柄上镶嵌了一颗大红宝石，闪闪发光。	0
1030	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
1031	“他为什么哭呢？”一只小绿蜥蜴问道,他把尾巴高高翘在空中，从他身边走过。	6
1032	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.'	3
1033	真正的爱是受熬煎，是沉默无语。	4
1034	Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'	4
1035	“她走了倒让我高兴，”他心下说，“她满脑子都是中产阶级思想。”他又往泥里坐了坐，开始考虑天才的孤独境遇，这时两个穿着白罩衫的小男孩儿突然从岸上跑了下来，拿着一把水壶和一些柴棍棍。	2
1036	他嗖地直冲云霄，人们都以为他一去不复返了呢。	8
1037	And was it not ten years from this day?'	7
1038	教授的女儿坐在门口往纺车上缠绕蓝色的丝，她的小狗卧在她脚旁。	7
1039	And the Star–Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him.	7
1040	“你在说你自己呢。”焰火筒回答说。	4
1041	“你挑选对了，”上帝说，“因为在我的乐园里，这只小鸟会永远唱下去，而在我的金子城市里，快乐王子会赞美我的。”	0
1042	我可以问一声，你生来就这副样子，还是一场事故造成的？”	5
1043	一点没错，只要起风了，芦苇就风情万种地行屈膝礼。	6
1044	新娘和新郎将要一起跳玫瑰舞，国王已答应吹笛伴乐。	7
1045	'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.'	7
1046	In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.	7
1047	我碰巧和糙纸做的药筒呆在一个抽屉里，今天早上我听到新娘新郎的所有故事,还听说了宫中的最新消息。“	6
1048	Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents, said the Waterrat, "I am not a family man. 	5
1049	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	4
1050	Everybody can see that.'	6
1051	Their little pink feet were quite frost–bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.	0
1052	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'	2
1053	“亲爱的小燕子，”王子说，“你告诉我许多奇闻轶事，不过受苦受难的男男女女的干万种痛苦，是什么奇闻轶事也比不了的。	8
1054	'Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller, 'friendship never forgets.	4
1055	王子和公主领衔起舞，	0
1056	在城堡的大门前，王子正在迎接她。	7
1057	It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.	0
1058	现在我一门心思在家务上，照顾好我的家庭。”	4
1059	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
1060	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
1061	“交谈，没错儿！”火箭说，	2
1062	“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你一定要飞往埃及去。”	1
1063	比如说，新娘和新郎这么年轻就彼此相爱了。	0
1064	“我天生就是过公共生活的料，”火箭说，“我的所有亲戚也离不开公共生活，哪怕他们十分渺小。	8
1065	他们果真把它扔在了垃圾堆上，碰巧那只死燕子也躺在那里。	6
1066	他飞了整整一天，天黑时分来到了这个城市。	7
1067	“尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	4
1068	“这是再自私不过的理由，”火箭生气地说，	2
1069	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
1070	Who is there who careth for us?	3
1071	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
1072	“我敢说，要是我早就认识他，我根本不会成为他的朋友。	7
1073	这根本就是城郊地带。	8
1074	“在广场那边，”快乐王子说，“站着一个卖火柴的小姑娘。	6
1075	And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love, and, after a time, he fell asleep.	7
1076	可是夜莺明白这位大学生的苦衷，呆在栎树丛里一声不吭，默想着爱情的秘密所在。	4
1077	放眼望去条条大街像裹上了银子，光亮夺目,明闪闪的,房子屋檐垂下长长的冰柱，像水晶利剑，人人出门都穿起皮衣，小孩子家头戴大红帽子，在冰上溜来溜去。	6
1078	I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.'	0
1079	How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!	8
1080	Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.	0
1081	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
1082	'Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.	0
1083	嗖！嗖！转轮焰火一圈又一圈地旋转着。	0
