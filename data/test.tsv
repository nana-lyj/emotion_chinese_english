1	“这是年轻的国王加冕典礼时要穿的袍子，”他回答，“这和你有什么关系？”	6
2	我们还是别理他，走我们的路吧，瞧瞧我们都是穷人，有自己的孩子要面包吃,给不起别的孩子的。”	8
3	又有一次，他一连数小时不知哪里去了，人们找了半天才在宫殿北边塔楼的一间小屋子找到了他，他一副神情恍惚的样子，正在细细端详一枚雕刻着阿多尼斯人像的希腊宝石。	6
4	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？”	2
5	Ahem! ahem! he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, "Romance is dead."	8
6	This must be the deputation, said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified.	8
7	I have six beautiful daughters.	0
8	他说完，扭过身来朝那条通向城门的街道看去，瞧！	6
9	“果真如此吗？”他问道，	6
10	The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.	8
11	那是花园最远的角落,一个小男孩儿正站在那里。	1
12	阿富汗人把那头黑公牛杀死了,正往战场开赴。	5
13	野外的鸟儿在树林里飞来飞去，自有它们的自由，	0
14	Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out,	0
15	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
16	寒风从森林刮过来，朝敞开的门吹去,冻得她浑身发抖，她哆哆嗦嗦对他说:“你还不快把门关上？	3
17	他走啊走啊，一直走到森林的外围,他在这里看见成干上万的人在干河床上劳作。	7
18	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.	2
19	“我们不知道，”孩子们回答说，“他离去了吧。”	8
20	年轻的国王端详着这些东西，发现它们很美丽，	0
21	别伤害它。	4
22	星孩皱起眉头心下思忖道：“他们对我说的话是什么意思呢？	8
23	It saves time, and prevents arguments."	8
24	Ah! what a trivial view of life! said the Rocket; "but it is only what I expected.	5
25	I am off to look for my daughters.	8
26	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket, and he began to cough.	8
27	至于你的那些梦嘛，别再多想了。	1
28	他们对他说：“是一个乞丐，一个要饭的孩子，我们把他赶走了。”	5
29	他往镜子里一看，见是他自己的脸,不禁大叫一声醒了过来，耀眼的阳光照进了屋子，花园和游乐园的树上传来鸟儿的鸣叫。	0
30	Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy, said the Dragonfly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.	7
31	他伸出手去，紧紧抓住那麻风病人苍白的脚，对他说：“我曾三次对你仁爱相待。	0
32	正是你皇族的华丽养育了我们啊，你的种种恶习使我们有面包吃。	4
33	Charming! charming!	0
34	按宫廷御医说，那个生下他的白人姑娘是死于悲伤或瘟疫；而另有人则说是用一杯配制好的意大利烈性毒酒让她服下，不到一小时就活活弄死了她;那个可靠的信差，把这孩子放在鞍子前面就跑了，等他跳下疲劳的马、敲开牧羊人小屋的柴门时，公主的尸体正在往挖开的墓穴里放。	3
35	我们戴着镣铐，却没有人能看得见；我们是奴隶，人却说我们享有自由“所有的人都是这样吗？”他问道。	3
36	“我怎么感谢你好呢？”星孩说，“瞧瞧吧！你可是第二次救了我啊。”	0
37	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
38	他大声招呼着他的同伴，说他找到从天上掉下来的那件宝贝了；他的同伴赶到后，他们坐在雪地里，把斗篷慢慢抖开,好把金子分了。	0
39	It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.	8
40	但是星孩看见她时，他对他的同伴说:“看呀！那棵漂亮的绿叶树下，坐着一个丑陋的要饭女人。	6
41	Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.	8
42	船长把珍珠称过,放进一个小绿皮袋子里。	0
43	我们今后怎么养活他呢？她生丈夫的气了。	2
44	我很清楚我的样子有多么可憎可恶！”	5
45	“谁竟敢伤害你？”巨人大声责问道，“快告诉我，看我拿上我的大剑，去把他砍了。”	2
46	It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick.	8
47	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
48	随后，那个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人手持盾牌大声喊叫说：“我的君主怎么能说他不美丽呢？”	6
49	I am made for public life, said the Rocket, "and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.	7
50	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	3
51	I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.	0
52	Pray, what are you laughing at? inquired the Rocket.	6
53	Very important for you, I have no doubt, answered the Rocket, "but I shall weep if I choose"; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.	0
54	快原谅我吧，让我回到那森林里去吧。”	7
55	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
56	谁会管我们饭吃？”	1
57	星孩看看盾里的那个人，瞧瞧吧！他的脸完全像过去一样，他的英俊又回到了他身上，他还在他的眼睛里看到了他过去不曾见过的东西。	6
58	But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.	1
59	闲人莫入，违者法办	3
60	One day the Giant came back. 	8
61	So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.	8
62	And the Star–Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before.	6
63	谁知道小东西会不会给咱家带来坏运气？	3
64	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
65	可是这些事情与你有什么关系？	6
66	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	1
67	他的嘴唇也像红花瓣儿一样，他的眼睛却像清水河旁的紫罗兰，他的身体更似割草人没有到过的草地上的水仙花一样。	6
68	In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!"	6
69	小侍从见了吃了一惊，瞪起他那蓝蓝的大眼睛，微笑着跟他说：“陛下，我看你有皇袍和权杖，可你的皇冠在哪里呢？	7
70	They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. 	5
71	I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.	0
72	This is magnificent, cried the Rocket, "they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me."	0
73	What a terrible misfortune! 	3
74	他重重地摔进了浪头里，他的伙伴赶快得得得跑走了。	1
75	第二天，魔术师来到他跟前，说:“今天你要是不把那块黄金给我带来，那我肯定要把你当奴隶使唤，抽你三百鞭子。”	3
76	Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, "but you are more beautiful than your picture"; and the little Princess blushed.	0
77	随后黑人们抓住奴隶中最小的一个，取掉了他的手铐，往他的鼻孔儿和耳朵眼儿灌满蜡油，在他腰间系了一块石头。	5
78	“如果我不穿上国王服装，他们就不会知道我是国王吗？”	6
79	“我看春天终于来了。”巨人说；他从床上跳下，往外张望。	0
80	朝臣这下全乐了，有人索性冲他大声喊：“陛下，人民在等待自己的国王，你却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒火顿生，说：“他为我们国家带来耻辱,不配做我们的一国之君。”	2
81	The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp. 	5
82	“是这话，”他的同伴说，“有些人得到的太多，有的人得到的太少。	8
83	What a success I am!"	0
84	他在睡觉时做了一个梦，下面就是他的梦：	7
85	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
86	天气确实冷得要命。	8
87	He was a very selfish Giant.	5
88	I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news."	4
89	“哎呀！一罐金子落下来了，谁拾到就是谁的。”他们嚷嚷说着，就开始跑起来，迫不及待地想得到金子。	7
90	“听我说，这完全是政府的失误，如果你不相信，那我就把你吃掉。”狼有一副不折不扣的好使的脑子，只要争论起来，他是从来不会输掉的。	2
91	一些憔悴的妇女围着一张桌子做针线活儿。	1
92	Somebody must listen, answered the Frog, "and I like to do all the talking myself.	8
93	星孩听了这话又一次对他大发慈悲，把那块红色的金子白送了他，说：“你比我更需要它。”	4
94	劝我母亲和我说一次话吧。”	7
95	At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.	1
96	Now I am going off! he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.	7
97	“胡扯！”狼嗥嗥叫道，	2
98	She is like a white rose! they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.	0
99	It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.	0
100	朝臣们听了大感惊诧，有的不禁失声大笑，他们满以为年轻的国王在开玩笑。	6
101	再往远处,在一片果园里，一只夜莺在欢唱。	0
102	他现在不讨厌冬天了，因为他知道那只不过是春天在沉睡，花儿在休息。	8
103	He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.	4
104	上帝造岀了蚊蜥蜴和疆鼠，它们各有自己的地盘。	8
105	“无上荣耀呀！”全体朝臣纷纷道贺说。	0
106	“没错儿，”信号焰火大声呼应说,他这时的情绪好了些，“这可是个常识问题。”	0
107	夜莺于是越来越紧地顶在刺上，她唱得也越来越瞭亮，因为她唱的是男子和女子的灵魂里产生了激情。	0
108	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name", and he leaned down and plucked it.	6
109	She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.	2
110	多么可怕的灾难！	3
111	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
112	“因为他不再美丽，所以就不再有用了。”大学的美术教授说。	5
113	'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	3
114	那个国王自己就在那里，躺在他的油漆棺材里。	8
115	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
116	“再见了，”流星火花大声喊叫着，直冲天空，撤下一路小小的蓝色火星。	6
117	这花儿美极了，准保有一个长长的拉丁名字。”他探下身子把玫瑰花儿摘掉了。	0
118	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
119	到我的城市上空去飞一趟，小燕子，回来告诉我你在下面看见了什么。”	7
120	Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.'	7
121	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
122	Sing me one last song, he whispered, "I shall feel very lonely when you are gone."	7
123	Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand.	7
124	“天哪！”鹅大声叫道，	6
125	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
126	Then you are quite behind the age, said the Water-rat.	6
127	God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.	4
128	我上一次见到他们,他们还在争吵昵。	4
129	The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.	6
130	But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.'	6
131	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
132	这位纤弱的公主长这么大还没有看见过放焰火，因此国王早已下了圣旨，皇家焰火匠在婚礼那天到场凑趣。	6
133	“世上还真有不折不扣的情种，”夜莺说，	6
134	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
135	这下我能写完我的剧本了。”他看上去相当幸福。	0
136	夜莺唱完歌儿时，大学生站起来，从口袋里抽出笔记本和铅笔。	6
137	'What is it?' she cried.	7
138	As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.	7
139	他亲吻过快乐王子的嘴唇，掉在王子脚下死去了。	1
140	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."	0
141	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	1
142	One red rose is all I want, cried the Nightingale, "only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?"	7
143	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。”	0
144	她没有穿鞋，没有穿袜子，还光着小脑袋。	1
145	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	1
146	“我从来没有说过他们赶上了倒霉的事，”火箭答道，“我只是说他们也许会有不幸。	8
147	There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.	6
148	“为一朵红玫瑰？”他们同声惊讶道，“真是咄咄怪事啊！”小蜥蜴是一个喜欢拿别人开心的人，忍不住哈哈笑出声来。	6
149	“这可是世间最红的玫瑰。	0
150	“国王的儿子真叫走运，”他说，“他结婚的那天我正好被燃放。	0
151	我这下把风头岀尽了！”	0
152	我讨厌那些夸夸其谈、口口声声离不开自己的人，你就这个德性,人家都还想谈谈自己呢，我就是这样。	5
153	And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.	0
154	旅行使人大长见识，摆脱一切偏见。	4
155	这是毫无疑问。	8
156	“我要去埃及！”燕子大声说，可是没有人在意，月亮升起来时，他又飞回快乐王子身边。	7
157	Even the cattle of the field praise Him.'	0
158	他浑身贴满了一片片赤金叶子，眼睛含着两颗晶莹的蓝宝石，佩剑的剑柄上镶嵌了一颗大红宝石，闪闪发光。	0
159	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
160	“他为什么哭呢？”一只小绿蜥蜴问道,他把尾巴高高翘在空中，从他身边走过。	6
161	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.'	3
162	真正的爱是受熬煎，是沉默无语。	4
163	Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'	4
164	“她走了倒让我高兴，”他心下说，“她满脑子都是中产阶级思想。”他又往泥里坐了坐，开始考虑天才的孤独境遇，这时两个穿着白罩衫的小男孩儿突然从岸上跑了下来，拿着一把水壶和一些柴棍棍。	2
165	他嗖地直冲云霄，人们都以为他一去不复返了呢。	8
166	And was it not ten years from this day?'	7
167	教授的女儿坐在门口往纺车上缠绕蓝色的丝，她的小狗卧在她脚旁。	7
168	And the Star–Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him.	7
169	“你在说你自己呢。”焰火筒回答说。	4
170	“你挑选对了，”上帝说，“因为在我的乐园里，这只小鸟会永远唱下去，而在我的金子城市里，快乐王子会赞美我的。”	0
171	我可以问一声，你生来就这副样子，还是一场事故造成的？”	5
172	一点没错，只要起风了，芦苇就风情万种地行屈膝礼。	6
173	新娘和新郎将要一起跳玫瑰舞，国王已答应吹笛伴乐。	7
174	'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.'	7
175	In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.	7
176	我碰巧和糙纸做的药筒呆在一个抽屉里，今天早上我听到新娘新郎的所有故事,还听说了宫中的最新消息。“	6
177	Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents, said the Waterrat, "I am not a family man. 	5
178	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	4
179	Everybody can see that.'	6
180	Their little pink feet were quite frost–bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.	0
181	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'	2
182	“亲爱的小燕子，”王子说，“你告诉我许多奇闻轶事，不过受苦受难的男男女女的干万种痛苦，是什么奇闻轶事也比不了的。	8
183	'Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller, 'friendship never forgets.	4
184	王子和公主领衔起舞，	0
185	在城堡的大门前，王子正在迎接她。	7
186	It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.	0
187	现在我一门心思在家务上，照顾好我的家庭。”	4
188	'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.	8
189	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
190	“交谈，没错儿！”火箭说，	2
191	“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你一定要飞往埃及去。”	1
192	比如说，新娘和新郎这么年轻就彼此相爱了。	0
193	“我天生就是过公共生活的料，”火箭说，“我的所有亲戚也离不开公共生活，哪怕他们十分渺小。	8
194	他们果真把它扔在了垃圾堆上，碰巧那只死燕子也躺在那里。	6
195	他飞了整整一天，天黑时分来到了这个城市。	7
196	“尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	4
197	“这是再自私不过的理由，”火箭生气地说，	2
198	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
199	Who is there who careth for us?	3
200	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
201	“我敢说，要是我早就认识他，我根本不会成为他的朋友。	7
202	这根本就是城郊地带。	8
203	“在广场那边，”快乐王子说，“站着一个卖火柴的小姑娘。	6
204	And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love, and, after a time, he fell asleep.	7
205	可是夜莺明白这位大学生的苦衷，呆在栎树丛里一声不吭，默想着爱情的秘密所在。	4
206	放眼望去条条大街像裹上了银子，光亮夺目,明闪闪的,房子屋檐垂下长长的冰柱，像水晶利剑，人人出门都穿起皮衣，小孩子家头戴大红帽子，在冰上溜来溜去。	6
207	I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.'	0
208	How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!	8
209	Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.	0
210	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
211	'Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.	0
212	嗖！嗖！转轮焰火一圈又一圈地旋转着。	0
