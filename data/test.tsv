1	“我们过得多么快乐幸福啊！ ”他们互相告慰道。	0
2	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	2
3	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
4	A delightful voice, certainly, continued the Frog; "I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.	7
5	她心里只有音乐，谁都知道艺术是自私的。	5
6	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
7	You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose, cried the Student.	7
8	一等他们把锚抛下，收好帆索，黑人们就到货舱里拿出一架长绳梯，上面拴着沉甸甸的铅块儿。	5
9	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
10	“真是怪事啊！”在铸造车间干活儿的工人监工说，	6
11	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
12	可是你可以到我兄弟那里去，他生长在那个大学生的窗子底下，也许他会给你想要的东西。”	7
13	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
14	他们飞走后，他感到很孤单，渐渐对他的恋人儿厌倦了。	5
15	摆放着玛瑙和天青石的大书柜占据一隅，而面朝窗户的是一个做工讲究、镶金涂漆的装板柜橱，只见上面摆着各种精致的威尼斯玻璃杯和一个暗纹石华杯。	8
16	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
17	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air; "impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	6
18	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
19	There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.	7
20	我能嗖地飞上天空，像金色阵雨一样落下来，你听了这话肯定会感到惊讶的。	6
21	He was very much admired indeed.	4
22	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
23	他飞入阴暗的小巷里看见那些饥饿的小孩带着苍白的瘦脸没精打彩地望着污秽的街道。	5
24	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	6
25	'Oh! they will come to you,' said the Miller, 'but you must take more pains.	7
26	But the Tree shook its head.	1
27	And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.	8
28	你一脸幸福哪。	0
29	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
30	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
31	“你的情况也许是这样，”他回答说，“而且我对此也深信不疑，可是我的情况就大不一样了。	4
32	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
33	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
34	That is the important thing.	4
35	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
36	He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.	8
37	于是他修建了一堵髙墙，把花园围起来，还挂上一块牌子：	8
38	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
39	有一天，村里来了一个穷要饭女人。	8
40	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
41	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	5
42	Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. 	8
43	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
44	If you want to give pleasure to others, cried the Roman Candle,you had better keep yourself dry.	8
45	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
46	You will hear our glee-club this evening.	7
47	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
48	Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.	6
49	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
50	That is not conversation.	8
51	“那颗破裂的铅心在炉里竟然没化掉。	6
52	他下海的地方冒上来几个水泡。	8
53	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!”	5
54	黑人们抓过他手里的珍珠，又把他推向海中。	3
55	真的，我一贯认为，苦活儿累活儿只是那些什么活儿都干不了的人的最后去处。”	5
56	As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.	7
57	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'	2
58	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	4
59	它真美，我相信它有一个长的拉丁名字；”他弯下身去摘了它。	4
60	“一点不错，”樵夫回答说，“正像你说的一样。”	8
61	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	0
62	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
63	乃但是他回答同伴说：“不，这斗篷既不是我的，也不是你的，是这孩子的他和同伴告别，走到自家门口，敲响了门。	8
64	'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's youngest son.	6
65	他低下头祈祷，穿着硬教袍的祭司们悄悄退下了祭坛。	4
66	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
67	“我是多么想见见他啊！”他经常说。	7
68	And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.	5
69	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
70	然而我有想象力，我从来就没有按事物的本来面貌去想,我总认为它们有截然不同的一面。	8
71	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	7
72	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
73	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
74	物革旦人的山区里正在打仗，双方的国王都在召唤你呢。	7
75	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说，	2
76	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
77	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
78	Upon my word,' said the Miller with anger, 'you are very lazy.	2
79	How lucky you mentioned it!	6
80	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
81	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	3
82	'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.	7
83	I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.	6
84	他被黄亚麻布裹得紧紧的，用各种香料涂过以防止腐烂。	8
85	“有人在埃及等我呢，”燕子回答说，	7
86	河马藏在香蒲下面，门农神由坐在一个大花岗岩宝座上。	8
87	But I am going to buy them all back again now.'	8
88	All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.	8
89	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
90	I am very glad I have travelled.	0
91	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	1
92	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
93	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
94	It is just like being in church.'	4
95	“如果你想给别人快乐，”焰火筒大声说，	4
96	“在远处一条小街上，有一所穷人住的房子。	8
97	快快滚到一边。	2
98	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
99	And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.	6
100	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
101	I hate people who cry over spilt milk.	5
102	“一定是那个代表来了。”火箭说,努力做出很有尊严的样子。	7
103	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
