1	'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.	7
2	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	5
3	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
4	That is the important thing.	4
5	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
6	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
7	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
8	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	4
9	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	2
10	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	7
11	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
12	他们飞走后，他感到很孤单，渐渐对他的恋人儿厌倦了。	1
13	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	0
14	可是你可以到我兄弟那里去，他生长在那个大学生的窗子底下，也许他会给你想要的东西。	7
15	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	0
16	他低下头祈祷，穿着硬教袍的祭司们悄悄退下了祭坛。	4
17	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
18	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	3
19	那颗破裂的铅心在炉里竟然没化掉。	6
20	你一脸幸福哪。	0
21	“有人在埃及等我呢，”燕子回答说。	7
22	“有人在埃及等我呢，”燕子回答说。	4
23	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	5
24	It is just like being in church.	4
25	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说。	5
26	“一定是那个代表来了。”火箭说,努力做出很有尊严的样子。	7
27	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
28	Oh! they will come to you, said the Miller, but you must take more pains.	1
29	A delightful voice, certainly, continued the Frog, I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.	7
30	“如果你想给别人快乐，”焰火筒大声说。	0
31	Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.	1
32	“我们过得多么快乐幸福啊！ ”他们互相告慰道。	0
33	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	5
34	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
35	All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.	5
36	'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.	0
37	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
38	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	7
39	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
40	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
41	Why is he weeping? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.	6
42	我能嗖地飞上天空，像金色阵雨一样落下来，你听了这话肯定会感到惊讶的。	0
43	快快滚到一边。	2
44	然而我有想象力，我从来就没有按事物的本来面貌去想,我总认为它们有截然不同的一面。	7
45	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	2
46	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air, impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	2
47	I am very glad I have travelled.	0
48	A delightful voice, certainly, continued the Frog, I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.	0
49	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air, impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	4
50	Oh! they will come to you, said the Miller, but you must take more pains.	7
51	它真美，我相信它有一个长的拉丁名字，他弯下身去摘了它。	4
52	How lucky you mentioned it!	0
53	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	5
54	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	1
55	All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.	1
56	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	1
57	How lucky you mentioned it!	6
58	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!”	5
59	There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.	7
60	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	5
61	他们路过那根柱子时，市长抬头看了看塑像：“我的天哪！这快乐王子看上去真寒確！ ”他说。	6
62	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	6
63	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	5
64	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	1
65	在远处一条小街上，有一所穷人住的房子。	1
66	Upon my word, said the Miller with anger, you are very lazy.	2
67	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	1
68	I hate people who cry over spilt milk.	5
69	“我们过得多么快乐幸福啊！ ”他们互相告慰道。	1
70	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
71	它真美，我相信它有一个长的拉丁名字，他弯下身去摘了它。	7
72	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
73	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	3
74	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	1
75	And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.	5
76	“我是多么想见见他啊！”他经常说。	7
77	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
78	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
79	然而那姑娘皱起了眉头。	5
80	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
81	“如果你想给别人快乐，”焰火筒大声说。	4
82	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	7
83	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	2

85	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	1
86	他飞入阴暗的小巷里看见那些饥饿的小孩带着苍白的瘦脸没精打彩地望着污秽的街道。	1
87	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	2
88	And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.	4
89	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	4

93	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	0
94	“真是怪事啊！”在铸造车间干活儿的工人监工说。	6
95	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
96	If you want to give pleasure to others, cried the Roman Candle,you had better keep yourself dry.	7
97	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
98	You will hear our glee-club this evening.	7
99	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	1
100	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air, impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	1
101	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	6
102	那颗破裂的铅心在炉里竟然没化掉。	1
103	He was very much admired indeed.	0
104	You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose, cried the Student.	0
105	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	1
106	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	3
107	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
108	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	1
109	But I am going to buy them all back again now.	7
110	Upon my word, said the Miller with anger, you are very lazy.	5
111	But the Tree shook its head.	1
112	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
113	If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.	4
114	她心里只有音乐，谁都知道艺术是自私的。	5
115	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
116	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
117	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	2
118	He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.	7
119	物革旦人的山区里正在打仗，双方的国王都在召唤你呢。	2
120	快快滚到一边。	5
121	Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. 	7
122	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	1
123	“红宝石从他的剑柄上脱落了，他的眼睛不见了，他身上的金子也没有了，”市长说，“说真的，他比乞丐强不到哪里去!”	1
124	我能嗖地飞上天空，像金色阵雨一样落下来，你听了这话肯定会感到惊讶的。	6
125	“一点不错，”樵夫回答说，“正像你说的一样。”	4
126	它真美，我相信它有一个长的拉丁名字，他弯下身去摘了它。	0
127	他们飞走后，他感到很孤单，渐渐对他的恋人儿厌倦了。	5

132	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
133	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	5
134	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
135	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说。	2
136	黑人们抓过他手里的珍珠，又把他推向海中。	2
137	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
138	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	7
139	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
140	真的，我一贯认为，苦活儿累活儿只是那些什么活儿都干不了的人的最后去处。	5
141	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
142	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	7
143	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
144	“你的情况也许是这样，”他回答说，而且我对此也深信不疑，可是我的情况就大不一样了。	4
145	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	4

152	有一天，村里来了一个穷要饭女人。	5
153	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	1

160	BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket? he said, as he whirled through the air, impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.	6
161	'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's youngest son.	6
162	Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.	7
163	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.	2
164	He was very much admired indeed.	4

169	他飞入阴暗的小巷里看见那些饥饿的小孩带着苍白的瘦脸没精打彩地望着污秽的街道。	5
170	一等他们把锚抛下，收好帆索，黑人们就到货舱里拿出一架长绳梯，上面拴着沉甸甸的铅块儿。	5
171	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
172	“我是多么想见见他啊！”他经常说。	4
