The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.-
Then another drop fell.-
But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw--Ah! what did he see?-
‘Who are you?’ he said.-
At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink.-
Through this he darted, and came into the room.-
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.-
‘It is winter,’ answered the Swallow, ‘and the chill snow will soon be here.-
You would be quite blind then.’-
So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it.-
Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.-
‘I am going to the House of Death.-
Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?’-
At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.-
It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.-
‘There is away,’ answered the Tree; ‘but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.’-
‘Tell it to me,’ said the Nightingale, ‘I am not afraid.’-
You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.-
All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.’-
I am afraid not.-
But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.-
‘Press closer, little Nightingale,’ cried the Tree, ‘or the Day will come before the rose is finished.’-
‘Press closer, little Nightingale,’ cried the Tree, ‘or the Day will come before the rose is finished.’-
So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.-
One day the Giant came back. -
He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.-
So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.-
TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED-
So the Hail came. -
So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.-
But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.-
‘Who art thou?’ said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.-
Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.-
Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.-
There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don't stop it up.-
Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'-
After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.-
‘'Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?' he inquired in a shy and timid voice.-
‘'Oh! on no account,' cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.-
‘Poor little Hans was afraid to say anything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain.-
‘Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.-
It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.-
But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.-
‘There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.-
My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.-
But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.'-
‘What a dreadful storm it was!-
The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand.-
However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor's house, and knocked at the door.-
‘'Who is there?' cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window.-
‘'The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.'-
‘But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.-
At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.-
I will certainly take care not to give away anything again.-
‘I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,’ answered the Linnet.-
‘Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,’ said the Duck.-
Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.-
He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.-
It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.’-
Then one of them caught sight of him.-
My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.’-
Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?-
I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.-
He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.-
‘What a curious shape you are!-
May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident?’-
At last, however, the fire caught him.-
Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.-
‘Now I am going to explode,’ he cried.-
Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.-
There was no doubt about it.-
‘Good heavens!’ cried the Goose.-
‘It is going to rain sticks’; and she rushed into the water.-
Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other. -
It was said that a stout Burgomaster, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods. -
He thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whir and clatter of many looms. -
A horrible odour filled the place. -
Art thou a spy set on us by our master?'-
'Who is thy master?' asked the young King. -
Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her. -
And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, 'What robe is this that thou art weaving?'-
And the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own chamber, and through the window he saw the great honey–coloured moon hanging in the dusky air. -
He thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being rowed by a hundred slaves. -
Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears, and in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales. -
Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and threw spears at them. -
The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of them in the throat. -
As soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes went into the hold and brought up a long rope–ladder, heavily weighted with lead. -
The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the ends fast to two iron stanchions. -
Then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his ears with wax, and tied a big stone round his waist. -
The young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move. -
Two cranes flew round and round the vessel. -
But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. -
He thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange fruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers. -
The adders hissed at him as he went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch. -
They swarmed up the crag like ants. -
They dug deep pits in the ground and went down into them. -
Some of them cleft the rocks with great axes; others grabbled in the sand. -
And Death said to her, 'What hast thou in thy hand?'-
'Give me one of them,' cried Death, 'to plant in my garden; only one of them, and I will go away. '-
A cold mist followed her, and the water–snakes ran by her side. -
There is war in the mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to thee. -
The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle. -
They have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put on their helmets of iron. -
'Nay,' answered Death, 'but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not go. -
And Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the forest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of flame. -
She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man that she touched died. -
And Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head. -
There is famine in the walled cities of Egypt, and the locusts have come up from the desert. -
The Nile has not overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis and Osiris. -
Plague was written upon her forehead, and a crowd of lean vultures wheeled round her. -
And Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his red horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind. -
And out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and horrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the sand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils. -
And the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man habited as a pilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver. -
And he grew pale, and said: 'For what king?'-
There is Blood in the heart of the ruby, and Death in the heart of the pearl. -
For how shall the people know that thou art a king, if thou hast not a king’s raiment?'-
'They will not know thee, my lord,' cried the Chamberlain. -
 Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us? And what cure hast thou for these things? -
And when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the soldiers thrust their halberts out and said, 'What dost thou seek here? None enters by this door but the King.'-
 And he told him his three dreams. -
The fierce robbers come down from the mountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors. -
The lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels. -
The wild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines upon the hill. -
The pirates lay waste the sea–coast and burn the ships of the fishermen, and take their nets from them. -
In the salt–marshes live the lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh them. -
Canst thou make these things not to be? Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board? Shall the lion do thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee? Is not He who made misery wiser than thou art?-
And suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished steel. -
And the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed their swords and did homage, and the Bishop’s face grew pale, and his hands trembled. -
The Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes place every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and in her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to have been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a poisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.-
When they caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the market– place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody. -
Suddenly, with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro’s hand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet and whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and chaunting some wild love–song in their strange guttural language. -
'He is a perfect horror!' screamed the Cactus. -
'Why, he is twisted and stumpy, and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs. Really he makes me feel prickly all over, and if he comes near me I will sting him with my thorns.' -
He would give her his own little bed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild horned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the hut.-
But where was she?-
He slipped through, and found himself in a splendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was so much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of great coloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern.-
Perhaps she was hiding behind that?-
So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.-
The little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half–afraid to go on.-
The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal–burners speaking—the Comprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase him. But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage. He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved her. Perhaps she was in the room beyond.-
Standing under the shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a little figure watching him.-
As he did so, the figure moved out also, and he saw it plainly.-
It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever beheld.-
Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked, and crooked–limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair.-
He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.-
He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.-
The face of the monster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror.-
He drew back, and it retreated.-
What is it?-
It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water.-
Could the shadows of things have colour and life and movement?-
The monster had a rose of its own, petal for petal the same!-
It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its heart with horrible gestures.-
He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.-
You must dance. The Infanta of Spain and the Indies wishes to be amused.'-
So beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled with wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and leaning over the side he clasped her in his arms. And when he touched her, she gave a cry like a startled sea–gull, and woke, and looked at him in terror with her mauve–amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might escape. But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to depart.-
So she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the Sea–folk. And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down into the water, trembling with a strange fear.-
'But how shall I send my soul from me?' cried the young Fisherman. 'Tell me how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.'-
Now early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man’s hand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest and knocked three times at the door.-
And the Priest beat his breast, and answered, 'Alack, alack, thou art mad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest part of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it. There is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it. It is worth all the gold that is in the world, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings. Therefore, my son, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be forgiven. And as for the Sea–folk, they are lost, and they who would traffic with them are lost also. They are as the beasts of the field that know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.'-
'Away! Away!' cried the Priest: 'thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be lost with her.'-
And when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each other, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name, and said to him, 'What hast thou to sell?'-
have a price, pretty boy, I have a price. What d’ye lack? What d’ye lack? I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but I. It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as white as milk. Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the Queen, she would follow thee all over the world. Out of the bed of the King she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee. And it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price. What d’ye lack? What d’ye lack? I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the broth with a dead man’s hand. Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he sleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother will slay him. With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I can show thee Death. What d’ye lack? What d’ye lack? Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty boy, thou shalt pay me a price.'-
'What wouldst thou?' asked the Witch, coming near to him.-
The Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.-
Only tell me how to get rid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.'-
'When the moon is full, when the moon is full,' she muttered.-
Then she peered all round, and listened.-
A blue bird rose screaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other.-
'To–night thou must come to the top of the mountain,' she whispered.-
'Go thou to–night, and stand under the branches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming.-
If a black dog run towards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away.-
If an owl speak to thee, make it no answer.-
'But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?' he made question.-
'By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,' she made answer.-
A great owl, with yellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no answer. A black dog ran towards him and snarled.-
At midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats.-
'Phew!' they cried, as they lit upon the ground, 'there is some one here we know not!' and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs. Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind.-
Then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid.-
'Faster, faster!' she cried, and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great terror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at last he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been there before.-
The young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.-
At last their eyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were upon him.-
But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made on his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name.-
For thou hast named what should not be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.'-
She grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.-
And she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green viper’s skin, and gave it to him.-
She was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her face.-
Stand on the sea–shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is thy soul’s body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.'-
The young Fisherman trembled. 'Is this true?' he murmured.-
And his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, 'Lo! I have dwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant. Send me not away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?'-
'The world is wide, and there is Heaven also, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between.-
The world is cruel, give me thy heart to take with me.'-
'Nay, but be merciful,' said his Soul: 'give me thy heart, for the world is very cruel, and I am afraid.'-
He crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe came over him.-
'Thou wilt not follow me into the depths of the sea?'-
'It may be that thou wilt have need of me.'-
Six days I journeyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is in the country of the Tartars.-
'When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land.-
When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and having leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it.-
The women fled screaming to the waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt curtains.-
They harnessed their horses to the waggons and drove hastily away.-
Three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them.-
'We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who curse the Moon.-
As we passed over the mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.-
As we passed through the valleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and at night–time we heard the wild men beating on their drums.-
When we came to the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us.-
When we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in howls of brass, and they let us go by.-
Three times in our journey we came to the banks of the Oxus.-
The river–horses raged against us and sought to slay us.-
When the camels saw them they trembled.-
'When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells and fled to the hill–summits.-
We fought with the Magadae who are born old, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are little children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of tigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns lest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians who worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it with butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog–faced; and with the Sibans, who have horses' feet, and run more swiftly than horses.-
I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.-
When they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid.-
The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business.-
They took hostages, and told us that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till then.-
And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they tarry in the city.-
'‘The god is hunting,’ said the priest, looking strangely at me with his small slanting eyes.-
It was carved out of ebony, and in stature was of the stature of a man.-
'And I said to the priest, ‘Is this the god?’ And he answered me, ‘This is the god.’-
'‘Show me the god,’ I cried, ‘or I will surely slay thee.’-
'And the priest besought me, saying, ‘Let my lord heal his servant, and I will show him the god.’-
'So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again, and he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol standing on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds.-
It was carved out of ivory, and in stature was twice the stature of a man.-
'And he answered me, ‘This is the god.’-
'‘Show me the god,’ I cried, ‘or I will surely slay thee.’-
'And the priest besought me, saying, ‘Let my lord heal his servant, and I will show him the god.’-
'So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to them, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo! there was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of round metal set on an altar of stone.-
Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.’-
'There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a bronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains.-
In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his hand.-
I saw a Syrian who held in his hands a thin rod like a reed.-
'One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the bazaar.-
They set down the palanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer.-
I had never seen any one so pale.-
The people flung themselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so.-
When the Emperor saw me, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped.-
The people marvelled at my boldness, and counselled me to flee from the city.-
As I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain across it.-
'As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony and cursed me. The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang upon the polished floor.-
Their fat bodies swayed as they walked, and they glanced curiously at me with their yellow–lidded eyes.-
One of them drew aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to him.-
Once the elder of the two turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile.-
'Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the pavilion.-
I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain aside I entered in.-
Behind him stood a brass–turbaned Nubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split ears.-
On a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of steel.-
'He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and rushing forward struck at me with great violence.-
The man fell sprawling on the floor, and when he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the couch.-
'The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms, he threw it at me.-
He shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it stopped in mid–air.-
Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather, and stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour.-
The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled from his lips.-
'As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, ‘Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?-
Give me half of thy treasure, and I will go away.’-
When the eunuchs saw me, their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear.-
When we reached the centre of the corridor the Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door swung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest his eyes should be dazzled.-
Nor shall I take aught from thee but that little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.’-
'‘Nay,’ I answered, ‘but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I know what is written within it, and for what purpose.’-
'And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said, ‘Take all the treasure and go from my city.-
And after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, 'Why dost thou call to me?'-
And his Soul said to him, 'Let us not tarry, but get hence at once, for the Sea–gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.'-
Nevertheless let us enter in.'-
And his Soul said to him, 'Take that silver cup and hide it.'-
So he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went hurriedly out of the city.-
Nevertheless let us enter in.'-
And the people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and said to his Soul, 'Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is not here.'-
But his Soul answered, 'Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and there will be robbers on the way.'-
And the merchant said to him, 'Why dost thou sit in the market–place, seeing that the booths are closed and the bales corded?'-
So the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house.-
And three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked him and said to him, 'Rise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to the room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold, for we have need of it.'-
And his Soul said to the young Fisherman, 'Strike him,' and he struck him so that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled hastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star that is the star of morning.-
'What sayest thou?' murmured the young Fisherman.-
For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin?-
Is there poison in that which is sweet to drink?-
Trouble not thyself, but come with me to another city.-
And ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible things.-
For of a truth pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who escapes from its net.-
Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague sits at their gates.-
The black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper.-
With white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.-
Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.-
Flee away to a place of safety.-
Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?'-
The fires cannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it.-
And after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance that was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again behind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to speak to them of the wrath of God.-
And the Priest trembled, and returned to his own house and prayed.-
It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.-
So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.-
If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.'-
Terribly cold it certainly was.-
The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.-
Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh–water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.-
Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'-
But he said to her, 'I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,' and he stirred not from the threshold.-
'What is it?' she cried.-
And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?-
And who giveth us food?'-
'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'-
There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.'-
No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.-
Snare them not for thy pleasure.-
Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?-
So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.-
And was it not ten years from this day?'-
How should I fly?'-
Dost thou seek to slay thine also?'-
And an old and evil–visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, 'I will buy him for that price,' and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star–Child by the hand and led him into the city.-
And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.-
And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star–Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn.-
And the Star–Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him.-
And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'-
Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.-

'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'-

And what dost thou seek in the wood?'-
And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'-
But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, 'Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.'-
And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'-
And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'-
