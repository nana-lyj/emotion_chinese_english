His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.-
‘Shall I love you?’ said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.-
This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.-
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?-
‘Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?-
‘It is very cold here,’ he said; ‘but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.’-
‘Thank you, little Swallow,’ said the Prince.-
‘How wonderful the stars are,’ he said to her, ‘and how wonderful is the power of love!’-
‘Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘will you not stay with me one night longer?’-
‘I will wait with you one night longer,’ said the Swallow, who really had a good heart. ‘Shall I take him another ruby?’-
Pluck out one of them and take it to him.-
‘Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘will you not stay with me one night longer?’-
Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.-
Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.’ -
‘I will stay with you one night longer,’ said the Swallow, ‘but I cannot pluck out your eye.-
‘You are blind now,’ he said, ‘so I will stay with you always.’-
‘I will stay with you always,’ said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.-
The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.-
‘Good-bye, dear Prince!’ he murmured, ‘will you let me kiss your hand?’-
‘I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.’-
‘Here at last is a true lover,’ said the Nightingale.-
‘The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,’ murmured the young Student, ‘and my love will be of the company.-
If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.-
‘Here indeed is the true lover,’ said the Nightingale.-
Surely Love is a wonderful thing.-
But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.’-
But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.’-
Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man?’-
All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.-
And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.-
It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name’; and he leaned down and plucked it.-
You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.’-
And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.-
The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.-
‘I have many beautiful flowers,’ he said; ‘but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.’-
Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.-
He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.-
‘Nay!’ answered the child; ‘but these are the wounds of Love.’-
THE DEVOTED FRIEND-
Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.-
‘I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.’-
‘Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.-
I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.-
However, he was so young that you must excuse him.’-
‘'And how have you been all the winter?' said the Miller.-
Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.-
‘'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.-
‘'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'-
‘'Oh, don't say that,' cried little Hans, 'I wouldn't be unfriendly for the whole world'; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders.-
‘'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'-
Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.-
Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.-
Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.'-
‘'It is some poor traveller,' said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.-
You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.'-
When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.-
Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.-
The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.-
That is what is called sympathy.-
However, I excuse your ignorance.-
 'He is a man like myself. -
'Are not the rich and the poor brothers?' asked the young King. -
 'A greater than I hath crowned thee,' he cried, and he knelt before him. -
So great had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave to hide her from him.-
He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for her, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of State; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its servants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which she suffered. -
They did not mind his being ugly, a bit. Why, even the nightingale herself, who sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon leaned down to listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides, he had been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when there were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as iron, and the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for food, he had never once forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs out of his little hunch of black bread, and divided with them whatever poor breakfast he had.-
He knew where the wood–pigeons built their nests, and once when a fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young ones himself, and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a pollard elm.-
Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest, and when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or carry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was not tall.-
He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he turned round, and kissed it.-
'In very truth I will let thee go,' said the young Fisherman.-
The novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he drew back the latch and said to him, 'Enter.'-
'What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?' asked the Witch, looking down at him with her beautiful eyes.-
So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.-
Suddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up two by two, knelt down, and kissed the man’s hands.-
'Thou knowest,' he made answer.-
'Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters,' and she fawned on him and put her face close to his.-
Do with it as thou wilt.'-
Go wherever thou wilt, but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.'-
'With what should I love my love if I gave thee my heart?' he cried.-
'Should I not love also?' asked his Soul.-
'Nay, but we must meet again,' said the Soul.-
'Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,' said the Soul.-
'What need should I have of thee?' cried the young Fisherman, 'but be it as thou wilt,' and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their horns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the mouth.-
'Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him Mohammed.-
'When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the hand, and placed me by his side.-
'Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him, I answered.-
‘Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,’ I answered.-
‘If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I will drink it with him also,’ was my answer.-
'Love is better than Wisdom,' he cried, 'and the little Mermaid loves me.'-
'He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.-
The half that is mine shall be thine also.’-
'Love is better than Riches,' he cried, 'and the little Mermaid loves me.'-
And on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, 'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?'-
'Are we not all kinsmen?' said the merchant.-
And after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the guest–chamber, and bade him sleep and be at rest.-
And so trouble not thyself nor me, but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not give away, nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive.'-
'Nay,' answered his Soul, 'but she was true to Him she worships, and whose servant she will be ever.'-
And when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, 'I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that I may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom I love has her dwelling.-
And his Soul tempted him and said, 'Who is thy love, that thou shouldst return to her?-
But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with the seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed back to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where his love had been wont to sing. And ever did his Soul tempt him by the way, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was within him.-
And when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his hands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the little Mermaid.-
And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night–time he spake her name.-
Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of his love.-
And after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, 'I have tempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am.-
But the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his love.-
And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night–time he spake her name.-
And after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman at night–time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, 'Lo! now I have tempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love is stronger than I am.-
Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray thee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as before.'-
'Surely thou mayest enter,' said the young Fisherman, 'for in the days when with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much suffered.'-
Cold were the lips, yet he kissed them.-
But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little Mermaid and said, 'Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.-
Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was it strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon evil and looked upon good.-
And his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his love.-
And as through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an entrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before.-
But the beauty of the white flowers troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came another word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of the God whose name is Love.-
And in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks and the musicians, and the candle–bearers and the swingers of censers, and a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the sea, and all the wild things that are in it.-
But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.-
But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'-
So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart.-
And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'-
But he answered him: 'Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,' and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked.-
And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.-
And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child.-
'Nay, but it is a Star–Child,' he answered; and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it.-
'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.-
And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.-
Do it no harm.-
And wherever the Star–Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star–Child bade them do, that did they.-
'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'-
And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.-
I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.'-
So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'-
And the woman answered him, 'I am thy mother.'-
'Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.-
Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.-
Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.'-
Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.'-
And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?-
Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.'-
'I am seeking for my mother,' he answered, 'and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.'-
And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, 'Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?'-
Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.-
And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'-
And the Hare answered him, and said: 'Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?'-
But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.-
'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'-
'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.-
But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.-
'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'-
'Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,' said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly.-
And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'-
Do thou give me love.-
Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.'-
And the beggar–woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, 'Rise,' and the leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, 'Rise,' also.-
And the Queen said to him, 'This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.'-
And the King said, 'This is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with thy tears.'-
Nor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast, but taught love and loving–kindness and charity, and to the poor he gave bread, and to the naked he gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in the land.-
