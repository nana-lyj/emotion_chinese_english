THE HAPPY PRINCE-
High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.-
He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.-
He was very much admired indeed.-
‘He is as beautiful as a weathercock,’ remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; ‘only not quite so useful,’ he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.-
‘The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.’-
 ‘He looks just like an angel,’ said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.-
He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.-
So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.-
And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.-
‘I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!’ and he flew away.-
All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.-
‘Where shall I put up?’ he said; ‘I hope the town has made preparations.’-
Then he saw the statue on the tall column.-
‘I will put up there,’ he cried; ‘it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.’ -
So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.-
‘What a curious thing!’ he cried; ‘there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.-
‘I am the Happy Prince.’-
In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.-
Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.-
My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.-
‘What! is he not solid gold?’ said the Swallow to himself.-
She is embroidering passionflowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-ofhonour to wear at the next Court-ball.-
‘My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotusflowers.-
He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.-
So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.-
He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.-
He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.-
A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.-
He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships.-
Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings.-
‘How cool I feel,’ said the boy, ‘I must be getting better’; and he sank into a delicious slumber.-
Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done.-
‘It is curious,’ he remarked, ‘but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.’-
‘That is because you have done a good action,’ said the Prince.-
When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.-
‘What a remarkable phenomenon,’ said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.-
‘A swallow in winter!’-
And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.-
Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.-
‘To-night I go to Egypt,’ said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.-
He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.-
Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, ‘What a distinguished stranger!’ so he enjoyed himself very much.-
When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.-
‘Have you any commissions for Egypt?’ he cried; ‘I am just starting.’-
‘I am waited for in Egypt,’ answered the Swallow.-
‘To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.-
The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.-
All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.-
They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract. ‘Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘far away across the city I see a young man in a garret.-
His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.-
They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.-
He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.’-
wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.-
‘I am beginning to be appreciated,’ he cried; ‘this is from some great admirer.-
Now I can finish my play,’ and he looked quite happy.-
‘Heave a-hoy!’ they shouted as each chest came up.-
In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.-
My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.-
The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.’-
‘In the square below,’ said the Happy Prince, ‘there stands a little match-girl.-
He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.-
‘What a lovely bit of glass,’ cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.-
Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.-
All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.-
He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.-
Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.’-
Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.-
Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.-
‘We have bread now!’ they cried.-
The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice. -
Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors.-
And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.-
Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.-
‘We must have another statue, of course,’ he said, ‘and it shall be a statue of myself.’-
‘What a strange thing!’ said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry.-
‘You have rightly chosen,’ said God, ‘for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.’-
‘Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.-
If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.-
It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.-
‘The musicians will sit in their gallery,’ said the young Student, ‘and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.-
She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her.-
‘Why, indeed?’ said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.-
‘Why, indeed?’ whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.-
Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.-
In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.-
‘Give me a red rose,’ she cried, ‘and I will sing you my sweetest song.’-
‘My roses are white,’ it answered; ‘as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.-
So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.-
‘Give me a red rose,’ she cried, ‘and I will sing you my sweetest song.’-
‘My roses are yellow,’ it answered; ‘as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.-
So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.-
‘Give me a red rose,’ she cried, ‘and I will sing you my sweetest song.’-
‘My roses are red,’ it answered, ‘as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.-
It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.-
Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.-
So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.-
‘Be happy,’ cried the Nightingale, ‘be happy; you shall have your red rose.-
Flamecoloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.-
His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.’-
So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.-
When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.-
Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.-
She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.-
And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.-
Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.-
As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.-
So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.-
And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride.-
And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.-
Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.-
Then she gave one last burst of music.-
The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.-
The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.-
Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.-
It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.-
And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.-
‘Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!’ he cried; ‘here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.-
Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand.-
The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.-
‘You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,’ cried the Student.-
‘Here is the reddest rose in all the world.-
‘I am afraid it will not go with my dress,’ she answered; ‘and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.’-
Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. -
It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. -
Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring- time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. -
The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.-
‘How happy we are here!’ they cried to each other.-
When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.-
They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.-
Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. -
The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. -
The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. -
Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came. -
‘This is a delightful spot,’ he said, ‘we must ask the Hail on a visit.’ -
One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.-
It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.-
It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.-
Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.-
‘I believe the Spring has come at last,’ said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.-
What did he see?-
He saw a most wonderful sight. -
Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.-
In every tree that he could see there was a little child.-
And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. -
The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. -
And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.-
I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever.’-
And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him.-
And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.-
‘It is your garden now, little children,’ said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall. -
And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.-
All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.-
‘You must tell him to be sure and come here tomorrow,’ said the Giant.-
Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.-
‘How I would like to see him!’ he used to say.-
He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.-
One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. -
He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.-
Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked. -
It certainly was a marvellous sight. -
In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.-
Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. -
For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.-
And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, ‘You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.’-
One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.-
He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.-
The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.-
Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.’-
‘Yes, that is just what I want to know,’ said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.-
‘And what would you do in return?’ said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.-
‘Let me tell you a story on the subject,’ said the Linnet.-
‘Is the story about me?’ asked the Water-rat.-
‘If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.’-
‘It is applicable to you,’ answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.-
‘Once upon a time,’ said the Linnet, ‘there was an honest little fellow named Hans.’-
‘Was he very distinguished?’ asked the Water-rat.-
‘No,’ answered the Linnet, ‘I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.-
He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.-
In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.-
Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds'-purses, and Fair-maids of France.-
There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.-
Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.-
‘'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.-
‘Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship.-
‘So little Hans worked away in his garden.-
That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.-
So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.'-
‘'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; 'very thoughtful indeed.-
It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.-
I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.'-
‘'But could we not ask little Hans up here?' said the Miller's youngest son.-
'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'-
Everybody can see that.'-
‘'How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; 'really I feel quite drowsy. It is just like being in church.'-
‘Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.-
That is the new method.-
I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.-
But pray go on with your story.-
I like the Miller immensely.-
I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.’-
‘Well,’ said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, ‘as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans.-
‘'Why, what a good heart you have'! cried his Wife; 'you are always thinking of others.-
And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.'-
‘'Good morning, little Hans,' said the Miller.-
‘'Good morning,' said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear.-
I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.'-
‘'That was kind of you,' said Hans; 'I was half afraid you had forgotten me.'-
That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye’!-
I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.'-
But I am going to buy them all back again now.'-
‘'Hans,' said the Miller, 'I will give you my wheelbarrow.-
It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.-
I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world.-
I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.-
Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.'-
‘'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.-
'I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.'-
‘'A plank of wood'! said the Miller; 'why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.-
How lucky you mentioned it!-
It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.-
Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.'-
‘'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.-
And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.-
‘'My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, 'you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.-
I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day'; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.-
‘'Good-bye,' said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.-
‘The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road.-
So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.-
‘There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.-
I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.'-
However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.-
Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing?'-
‘'Well, I am glad of that,' said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, 'for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.'-
‘He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on.-
‘'Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?' cried the Miller in a cheery voice.-
‘'It is quite mended,' answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.-
‘'Ah'! said the Miller, 'there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.'-
‘'It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,' answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, 'a very great privilege.-
At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.'-
‘'Do you really think I shall?' asked little Hans.-
‘'I have no doubt of it,' answered the Miller, 'but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.'-
‘'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.-
is an act of pure generosity.'-
‘So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.-
‘'Well, never mind, I will do without it,' cried little Hans, and he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off.-
‘'Little Hans, Doctor.'-
‘'All right!' said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.-
cakes.-
‘The moral.’-
‘Certainly,’ said the Linnet.-
‘And how do you like the Water-rat?’ asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards.-
‘The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.’-
And I quite agree with her.-
THE REMARKABLE ROCKET-
The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.-
He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived.-
She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.-
The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.-
So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.-
‘She is like a white rose!’ they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.-
At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.-
He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.-
‘Your picture was beautiful,’ he murmured, ‘but you are more beautiful than your picture’; and the little Princess blushed.-
‘She was like a white rose before,’ said a young Page to his neighbour, ‘but she is like a red rose now’; and the whole Court was delighted.-
For the next three days everybody went about saying, ‘White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose’; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.-
As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.-
When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.-
It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.-
Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.-
The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.-
‘It's quite clear that they love each other,’ said the little Page, ‘as clear as crystal!’ and the King doubled his salary a second time.-
‘What an honour!’ cried all the courtiers.-
After the banquet there was to be a Ball.-
The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.-
Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out,-
‘Charming! charming!’-
The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.-
The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.-
‘What are fireworks like?’ she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.-
‘They are like the Aurora Borealis,’ said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, ‘only much more natural.-
I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.-
You must certainly see them.’-
So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.-
‘The world is certainly very beautiful,’ cried a little Squib.-
‘Just look at those yellow tulips.-
Why! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.-
I am very glad I have travelled.-
Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.’-
It is like the moon, and lives for ever.-
I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news.’-
She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.-
He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.-
He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.-
As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.-
In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.-
‘How fortunate it is for the King's son,’ he remarked, ‘that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.-
Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.’-
I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.-
My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.-
When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.-
She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.-
My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.-
He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.-
The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.-
Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art.’-
No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.’-
‘A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,’ answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.-
‘I am laughing because I am happy,’ replied the Cracker.-
It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.-
‘If you want to give pleasure to others,’ cried the Roman Candle,-
‘Certainly,’ exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; ‘that is only common sense.’-
But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.-
The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.-
‘Well, really,’ exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, ‘why not? It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.-
You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.’-
‘That is the important thing.’-
Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.-
The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.-
They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.-
Then ten o'clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.-
‘Let the fireworks begin,’ said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.-
He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.-
It was certainly a magnificent display.-
Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round.-
Boom! Boom! went the Roman Candle.-
Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.-
‘Good-bye,’ cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.-
Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.-
All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire.-
Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.-
The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.-
Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.-
‘A new arrival, I see!’ said the Frog.-
‘Well, after all there is nothing like mud.-
Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.-
‘What a delightful voice you have!’ cried the Frog.-
‘Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.-
You will hear our glee-club this evening.-
We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin.-
It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.-
It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.’-
‘A delightful voice, certainly,’ continued the Frog; ‘I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.-
Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.’-
It saves time, and prevents arguments.’-
‘But I like arguments,’ said the Rocket.-
‘I hope not,’ said the Frog complacently.-
Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.-
In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model.-
Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.-
I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.-
I like hearing myself talk.-
It is one of my greatest pleasures.-
I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.’-
‘Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,’ said the Dragonfly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.-
‘I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.-
However, I don't care a bit.-
After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.-
She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.-
‘Quack, quack, quack,’ she said.-
You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.’-
We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.-
I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.’-
‘Oh! dear no,’ cried the Rocket.-
‘I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.-
I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.’-
‘I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,’ remarked the Duck; ‘there are so many things that need reforming.-
Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.’-
‘I am made for public life,’ said the Rocket, ‘and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.-
Whenever we appear we excite great attention.-
I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.-
‘Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!’ said the Duck; ‘and that reminds me how hungry I feel’: and she swam away down the stream, saying, ‘Quack, quack, quack.’-
‘This must be the deputation,’ said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified.-
‘Hallo!’ cried one of the boys, ‘look at this old stick! I wonder how it came here’; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.-
‘OLD Stick!’ said the Rocket, ‘impossible! GOLD Stick, that is what he said.-
Gold Stick is very complimentary.-
‘Let us put it into the fire!’ said the other boy, ‘it will help to boil the kettle.’-
So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.-
‘This is magnificent,’ cried the Rocket, ‘they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me.’-
‘I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun. In fact, I shall go so high that--’-
Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.-
‘Delightful!’ he cried, ‘I shall go on like this for ever. What a success I am!’-
‘I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.’-
And he certainly did explode.-
Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.-
‘I knew I should create a great sensation,’ gasped the Rocket, and he went out.-
THE YOUNG KING-
The lad—for he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age—was not sorry at their departure, and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of relief on the soft cushions of his embroidered couch, lying there, wild–eyed and open–mouthed, like a brown woodland Faun, or some young animal of the forest newly snared by the hunters. -
And, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost by chance as, bare–limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of the poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always fancied himself to be. -
And it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had shown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have so great an influence over his life. -
Those who accompanied him to the suite of rooms set apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of pleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and rich jewels that had been prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy with which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin cloak. -
Upon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them—and, indeed, they were to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be accompanied by the slim, fair–haired Court pages, with their floating mantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone, feeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely worshipper. -
Many curious stories were related about him at this period. -
He had been seen, so the tale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the building of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the Bithynian slave of Hadrian. -
He had passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion. -
All rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him, and in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants, some to traffic for amber with the rough fisher–folk of the north seas, some to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties, some to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to India to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade, sandal–wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool. -
But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby–studded crown, and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls. -
The designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given orders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out, and that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be worthy of their work. -
He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes. -
The walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty. -
A large press, inlaid with agate and lapis–lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, and a cup of dark–veined onyx. -
A laughing Narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head. -
On the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst. -
Far away, in an orchard, a nightingale was singing. -
A faint perfume of jasmine came through the open window. -
He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords. -
Never before had he felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery of beautiful things. -
When midnight sounded from the clock–tower he touched a bell, and his pages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose–water over his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow. -
And as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream. -
As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads together. -
The young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and watched him. -
'The land is free,' said the young King, 'and thou art no man’s slave. -
Thy face is too happy. -
And he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream. -
On a carpet by his side the master of the galley was seated. -
He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson silk. -
The salt spray flew from the blades. -
At last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings. -
Some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side. -
After some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to the ladder with a pearl in his right hand. -
Again and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with him a beautiful pearl. -
The master of the galley weighed them, and put them into a little bag of green leather. -
Then the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought with him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like the full moon, and whiter than the morning star. -
And the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the pearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed. -
 'It shall be,' he said, 'for the sceptre of the young King,' and he made a sign to the negroes to draw up the anchor. -
And he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream. -
The trees were full of apes and peacocks. -
They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was idle. -
 'They are my servants,' she answered. -
And Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water, and out of the cup rose Ague. -
And Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman came flying through the air. -
'For rubies for a king’s crown,' answered one who stood behind him. -
And the pilgrim answered: 'Look in this mirror, and thou shalt see him.'-
And he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great cry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and from the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing. -
And the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and made obeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold, and set the crown and the sceptre before him. -
And the young King looked at them, and they were beautiful. -
More beautiful were they than aught that he had ever seen. -
And the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, 'My lord, I pray thee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe, and set this crown upon thy head. -
 'Is it so, indeed?' he questioned. -
And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, 'My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?'-
And the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over the balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it, and set it on his own head. -
'This shall he my crown,' he answered. -
And thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great Hall, where the nobles were waiting for him. -
And he drew rein and said, 'Nay, but I am the King. -
By your pomp we are nurtured, and your vices give us bread. -
Therefore go back to thy Palace and put on thy purple and fine linen. -
And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress, he rose up in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, 'My son, is this a king’s apparel? And with what crown shall I crown thee, and what sceptre shall I place in thy hand? Surely this should be to thee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement.'-
Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast done, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and put on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I will crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand. -
He stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his left were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow wine, and the vial with the holy oil. -
He knelt before the image of Christ, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and the smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome. -
And lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him, and the sun–beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the robe that had been fashioned for his pleasure. -
The dead staff blossomed, and bare lilies that were whiter than pearls. -
The dry thorn blossomed, and bare roses that were redder than rubies. -
Whiter than fine pearls were the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver. -
Redder than male rubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold. -
He stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled shrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many–rayed monstrance shone a marvellous and mystical light. -
He stood there in a king’s raiment, and the Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move. -
In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and the organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets, and the singing boys sang. -
And the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through the midst of the people. -
But no man dared look upon his face, for it was like the face of an angel. -
THE BIRTHDAY OF THE INFANTA-
It was the birthday of the Infanta. She was just twelve years of age, and the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace.-
Although she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she had only one birthday every year, just like the children of quite poor people, so it was naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that she should have a really fine day for the occasion. And a really fine day it certainly was. -
The purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their wings, visiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out of the crevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare; and the pomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed their bleeding red hearts. -
Even the pale yellow lemons, that hung in such profusion from the mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades, seemed to have caught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia trees opened their great globe–like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled the air with a sweet heavy perfume.-
The little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her companions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old moss–grown statues.-
On ordinary days she was only allowed to play with children of her own rank, so she had always to play alone, but her birthday was an exception, and the King had given orders that she was to invite any of her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse themselves with her. -
There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish children as they glided about, the boys with their large–plumed hats and short fluttering cloaks, the girls holding up the trains of their long brocaded gowns, and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of black and silver.-
But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the most tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day.-
Her robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the wide puffed sleeves heavily embroidered with silver, and the stiff corset studded with rows of fine pearls.-
Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her dress as she walked.-
Pink and pearl was her great gauze fan, and in her hair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round her pale little face, she had a beautiful white rose.-
To–day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle of Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still younger. -
They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal Nuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had returned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his carriage.-
Later on had followed the marriage, hastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two countries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than usually solemn auto–da–fe, in which nearly three hundred heretics, amongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned.-
She had all the Queen’s pretty petulance of manner, the same wilful way of tossing her head, the same proud curved beautiful mouth, the same wonderful smile—vrai sourire de France indeed—as she glanced up now and then at the window, or stretched out her little hand for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss. -
Besides, he would miss the sham bull–fight for which the trumpet was already sounding, to say-
Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were much more sensible. -
They had come out on the terrace, and paid her nice compliments. -
So she tossed her pretty head, and taking Don Pedro by the hand, she walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of purple silk that had been erected at the end of the garden, the other children following in strict order of precedence, those who had the longest names going first.-
A procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as toreadors, came out to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra–Nueva, a wonderfully handsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all the grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to a little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the arena. -
The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance.-
Even the Duchess—the Camerera–Mayor as she was called—a thin, hard–featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not look quite so bad–tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile flitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips.-
It certainly was a marvellous bull–fight, and much nicer, the Infanta thought, than the real bull–fight that she had been brought to see at Seville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.-
Some of the boys pranced about on richly–caparisoned hobby–horses brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull, and vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for the bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made of wicker–work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of doing.-
He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so excited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace handkerchiefs and cried out: Bravo toro! Bravo toro! just as sensibly as if they had been grown–up people.-
At last, however, after a prolonged combat, during which several of the hobby–horses were gored through and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of Tierra–Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained permission from the Infanta to give the coup de grace, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head came right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de Lorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.-
The arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead hobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and black liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French posture–master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets appeared in the semi–classical tragedy of Sophonisba on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose.-
An African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered with a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he took from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it.-
In a few moments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge–shaped heads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water.-
The children, however, were rather frightened at their spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased when the juggler made a tiny orange–tree grow out of the sand and bear pretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the fan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las–Torres, and changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang, their delight and amazement knew no bounds.-
The solemn minuet, too, performed by the dancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming. -
So she had known only by hearsay of 'Our Lady’s Dance,' as it was called, and it certainly was a beautiful sight.-
The boys wore old–fashioned court dresses of white velvet, and their curious three–cornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling whiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being still more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair.-
Everybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved through the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of their slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in return for the pleasure that she had given her.-
A troop of handsome Egyptians—as the gipsies were termed in those days—then advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross–legs, in a circle, began to play softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to the tune, and humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air.-
After that they had done this several times, they disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear by a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little Barbary apes. -
The bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity, and the wizened apes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to be their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and fired off guns, and went through a regular soldier’s drill just like the King’s own bodyguard. -
In fact the gipsies were a great success.-
But the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was undoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf. -
When he stumbled into the arena, waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head from side to side, the children went off into a loud shout of delight, and the Infanta herself laughed so much that the Camerera was obliged to remind her that although there were many precedents in Spain for a King’s daughter weeping before her equals, there were none for a Princess of the blood royal making so merry before those who were her inferiors in birth. -
The Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the Spanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible, so fantastic a little monster had never been seen. -
It was his first appearance, too. -
Perhaps the most amusing thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own grotesque appearance.-
Indeed he seemed quite happy and full of the highest spirits.-
When the children laughed, he laughed as freely and as joyously as any of them, and at the close of each dance he made them each the funniest of bows, smiling and nodding at them just as if he was really one of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that Nature, in some humourous mood, had fashioned for others to mock at.-
As for the Infanta, she absolutely fascinated him.-
that he might cure the King’s melancholy by the sweetness of his voice, she took out of her hair the beautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and partly to tease the Camerera, threw it to him across the arena with her sweetest smile, he took the whole matter quite seriously, and pressing the flower to his rough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart, and sank on one knee before her, grinning from ear to ear, and with his little bright eyes sparkling with pleasure.-
This so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on laughing long after the little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and expressed a desire to her uncle that the dance should be immediately repeated.-
The Camerera, however, on the plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it would be better that her Highness should return without delay to the Palace, where a wonderful feast had been already prepared for her, including a real birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it in painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top.-
The Infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of siesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra–Nueva for his charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children following in the same order in which they had entered.-
Now when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran out into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight.-
Violets themselves felt that the ugliness of the little Dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that he would have shown much better taste if he had looked sad, or at least pensive, instead of jumping about merrily, and throwing himself into such grotesque and silly attitudes.-
But somehow the Birds liked him. -
They had seen him often in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the hollow of some old oak–tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels. -
So they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their wings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf was so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white rose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him because she loved him.-
They did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that made no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise, which is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier.-
Well–bred people always stay exactly in the same place, as we do. -
No one ever saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon–flies. -
This is dignified, and as it should be.-
But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed birds have not even a permanent address.-
So they put their noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.-
He liked the birds and the lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most marvellous things in the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but then she had given him the beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and that made a great difference.-
She would have put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he would have never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and taught her all kinds of delightful tricks.-
For though he had never been in a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful things.-
He could make little cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.-
He knew the cry of every bird, and could call the starlings from the tree–top, or the heron from the mere.-
He knew the trail of every animal, and could track the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the trampled leaves.-
All the wild–dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with the autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with white snow–wreaths in winter, and the blossom–dance through the orchards in spring.-
They were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands every morning.-
She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried about in the long fern, and the jays with their steely feathers and black bills, and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly balls, and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking their heads and nibbling at the young leaves.-
Yes, she must certainly come to the forest and play with him.-
And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they would go out and dance together all the day long.-
It was really not a bit lonely in the forest.-
Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white mule, reading out of a painted book.-
Sometimes in their green velvet caps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with hooded hawks on their wrists.-
At vintage–time came the grape–treaders, with purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine; and the charcoal–burners sat round their huge braziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves and made merry with them.-
Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession winding up the long dusty road to Toledo.-
The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands.-
He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find her others.-
He would bring her acorn–cups and dew–drenched anemones, and tiny glow–worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair.-
He wandered all round looking for some place through which he might gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private door that was lying open.-
At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered on the colour he loved best.-
No; there was only another room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had just left.-
The walls were hung with a many–figured green arras of needle–wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish artists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.-
It had once been the chamber of Jean le Fou, as he was called, that mad King who was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his delirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the stag on which the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting horn, and stabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.-
It was now used as the council–room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of the ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms and emblems of the house of Hapsburg.-
It was a throne–room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when the King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a personal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had appeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their Queen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor’s eldest son. The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling. Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on which the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls. On the second step of the throne was placed the kneeling–stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that again, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King’s presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal’s hat, with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple tabouret in front. On the wall, facing the throne, hung a life–sized portrait of Charles V. in hunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip II. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall. Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein’s Dance of Death had been graved—by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.-
He would not have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white petal of his rose for the throne itself.-
What he wanted was to see the Infanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away with him when he had finished his dance.-
Here, in the Palace, the air was close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.-
There were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and grassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the oak–trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and irises lilac and gold.-
There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee–haunted cells.-
The chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty.-
Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!-
She would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her delight.-
A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he passed into the next room.-
Of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.-
The walls were covered with a pink–flowered Lucca damask, patterned with birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of massive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in front of the two large fire–places stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea–green onyx, seemed to stretch far away into the distance.-
His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.-
The Infanta!-
He laughed, and it laughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was doing.-
He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence.-
He went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he made, and stopping when he stopped himself.-
He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as cold as ice.-
It imitated him.-
The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the doorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that stood in the sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.-
Was it Echo?-
He had called to her once in the valley, and she had answered him word for word.-
Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?-
Could it be that—?-
And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions through the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most fantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy laughter, and stood all round him and watched him.-
'His dancing was funny,' said the Infanta; 'but his acting is funnier still.-
Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not quite so natural.'-
And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded.-
'That is capital,' said the Infanta, after a pause; 'but now you must dance for me.'-
They smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down, and slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove.-
'But why will he not dance again?' asked the Infanta, laughing.-
When the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at best, for it was a bitter and black–winged wind, and rough waves rose up to meet it. But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from the deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the market–place and sold them. Every evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat. And he laughed, and said to himself, 'Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,' and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms. He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last to the top of the water.-
'Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?' cried the Mermaid.-
Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to the Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him. Round and round her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.-
And she sang a marvellous song. For she sang of the Sea–folk who drive their flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their shoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts, and blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of the King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a pavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like silver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon in the ribbed yellow sand. She sang of the big whales that come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the Sirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop their ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water and be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the frozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open portholes; of the little barnacles who are great travellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round the world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and stretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will it. She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the mariners; and of the sea–lions with their curved tusks, and the sea–horses with their floating manes.-
And as she sang, all the tunny–fish came in from the deep to listen to her, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them, and others he took with a spear. And when his boat was well–laden, the Mermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him.-
Yet would she never come near him that he might touch her. Oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see her again that day. And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears. So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no care of his craft. Vermilion–finned and with eyes of bossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not. His spear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were empty. With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his boat and listened, listening till the sea–mists crept round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.-
And one evening he called to her, and said: 'Little Mermaid, little Mermaid, I love thee. Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.' But the Mermaid shook her head. 'Thou hast a human soul,' she answered. 'If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.' And the young Fisherman said to himself, 'Of what use is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it. Surely I will send it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.' And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his arms to the Mermaid. 'I will send my soul away,' he cried, 'and you shall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the sea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt show me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be divided.'-
And the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her hands.-
And at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at the head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries. And he set to and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the sand of the shore. By the itching of her palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down her red hair. With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the opening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming.-
The Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand. 'Thou must dance with me, pretty boy,' she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.-
'Nought but that?' cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his feet.-
'Nought but that,' she answered, and she smiled at him again.-
'Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,' he said, 'and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I desire to know.'-
'It is a Sabbath, and He will be there.'-
The young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white teeth and laughed. 'Who is He of whom thou speakest?' he asked.-
When the moon is full I shall be with thee, and we will dance together on the grass.'-
She moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the wind.-
'Thou art the best of the witches,' cried the young Fisherman, 'and I will surely dance with thee to–night on the top of the mountain.-
I would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver.-
But such as thy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.'-
And he doffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a great joy.-
Like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing–boats moved in the little bay.-
She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks' eyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head.-
'Where is he, where is he?' shrieked the witches when they saw her, but she only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance.-
Round and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he could see the scarlet heels of her shoes.-
It was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish fashion.-
His face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red flower.-
On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat, and a pair of riding–gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed–pearls wrought into a curious device.-
A short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings.-
He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the waist, and whirled her madly round and round.-
As they did so, a little smile touched his proud lips, as a bird’s wing touches the water and makes it laugh.-
'Come! let us worship,' whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a great desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed her.-
The man went over to a little wood, and whistled.-
A jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him.-
He laughed, and held her all the more tightly.-
'What shall this serve me?' he asked of her, wondering.-
Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling strangely she said to him, 'What men call the shadow of the body is not the shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul.-
And the young Fisherman laughed.-
Bronze–limbed and well–knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood on the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white arms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did him homage.-
Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul, and behind him hung the moon in the honey–coloured air.-
He tossed his head and smiled.-
And the Soul answered, 'Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.'-
So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened.-
From the East cometh everything that is wise.-
The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper.-
'When the moon rose I saw a camp–fire burning on the plain, and went towards it.-
A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets.-
Their camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their servants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a high wall of the prickly pear.-
'I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped from the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave.-
The chief smiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo.-
A negro brought me some mare’s milk in a wooden dish, and a piece of lamb’s flesh roasted.-
'At daybreak we started on our journey.-
I rode on a red–haired camel by the side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear.-
The men of war were on either hand, and the mules followed with the merchandise.-
There were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were twice forty in number.-
We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white rocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves.-
We crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of blown hide.-
They threw us bread over the walls, little maize–cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.-
For every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber.-
'In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.-
We took the ripe pomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet juices. Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn.-
It was wrought out of red bronze, and carved with sea–dragons and dragons that have wings.-
The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from the island of Syria with much merchandise.-
'When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people came crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the city crying through a shell.-
We stood in the market–place, and the negroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests of sycamore.-
And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth their strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen from the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the blue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.-
From the roof of a house a company of women watched us.-
One of them wore a mask of gilded leather.-
'And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the second day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and the slaves.-
The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the green trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose–red house in which the god had his dwelling.-
Its doors were of powdered lacquer, and bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.-
The tilted roof was of sea–green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were festooned with little bells.-
When the white doves flew past, they struck the bells with their wings and made them tinkle.-
'In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.-
One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me. He had sandals on his feet, one of soft serpent–skin and the other of birds' plumage.-
On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents.-
Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair was stained with antimony.-
'After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire.-
'I told him that my desire was to see the god.-
He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails. -
‘The god is at the feast,’ he cried.-
'He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me up, and led me into the temple.-
'And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper bordered with great orient pearls. -
Its feet were red with the blood of a newly–slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with seven beryls.-
On its forehead was a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.-
In one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round crystal.-
It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was circled with a circle of selenites.-
And they who possess this mirror know everything, nor is there anything hidden from them.-
Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.-
Suffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.'-
But the young Fisherman laughed.-
'Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,' said the Soul.-
And the Soul answered, 'Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.'-
So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened.-
From the South cometh everything that is precious.-
Six days I journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter, along the dusty red–dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go did I journey, and on the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes, and lo! the city lay at my feet, for it is in a valley.-
The walls are cased with copper, and the watch–towers on the walls are roofed with brass.-
At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he blows through a horn of horn.-
I made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca, where there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver letters by the hands of the angels. They were filled with wonder, and entreated me to pass in.-
'Inside it is even as a bazaar.-
Across the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large butterflies.-
When the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as painted bubbles do.-
In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets.-
They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered with golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach–stones glide through their cool fingers.-
Some of them sell galbanum and nard, and curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea, and the thick oil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail–shaped cloves.-
When one stops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a charcoal brazier and make the air sweet.-
Grey threads of smoke came from it, and its odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring.-
Others sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise stones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers' claws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in gold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and finger–rings of hollowed jade.-
From the tea–houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the opium–smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers–by.-
The wine–sellers elbow their way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders.-
Most of them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey.-
They serve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it.-
In the market–place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and yellow as topazes, citrons and rose–apples and clusters of white grapes, round red–gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.-
Once I saw an elephant go by. Its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric, and over its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord.-
It stopped opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed. Thou canst not think how strange a people they are.-
It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion lacquer studded with brass peacocks.-
Across the windows hung thin curtains of muslin embroidered with beetles' wings and with tiny seed–pearls, and as it passed by a pale–faced Circassian looked out and smiled at me.-
I felt a great curiosity come over me.-
'At last they stopped at a square white house.-
An Armenian in a caftan of green leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them he opened, and spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out.-
As she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again. -
On the feast of the New Moon the young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to pray.-
His hair and beard were dyed with rose–leaves, and his cheeks were powdered with a fine gold dust.-
The palms of his feet and hands were yellow with saffron.-
'At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at sunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.-
'That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea–house that is in the Street of Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the palace.-
Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round.-
The walls were of white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green tiles.-
The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of peach–blossom marble.-
I had never seen anything like it before.-
They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I found myself in a watered garden of seven terraces. It was planted with tulip–cups and moonflowers, and silver–studded aloes.-
Like a slim reed of crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air.-
From one of them a nightingale was singing.-
'At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion.-
As we approached it two eunuchs came out to meet us.-
The other kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an affected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel.-
'After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers.-
They went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and plucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed.-
'The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a gerfalcon perched upon his wrist.-
The blade whizzed through me, and did me no hurt.-
'And I answered him, ‘I will go for half of thy treasure.-
When the captain of the guard saw me, he wondered.-
'There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry, and a brass–sealed ceiling hung with lamps.-
The Emperor touched one of the walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches.-
In niches upon each side stood great wine–jars filled to the brim with silver pieces.-
'Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.-
There were huge tortoise–shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies.-
The gold was stored in coffers of elephant–hide, and the gold–dust in leather bottles.-
There were opals and sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade.-
Round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some with turquoise–stones, and others with beryls.-
The ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards.-
The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of yellow lynx–stones.-
In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both wine–coloured and coloured like grass.-
And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there.-
'And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he said to me: ‘This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is thine, even as I promised to thee.-
And I will give thee camels and camel drivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.-
'But I answered him, ‘The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also is thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.-
As for me, I have no need of these.-
'And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave that is but a day’s journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of Riches.-
It is but a day’s journey from this place, and it waits for thy coming.-
He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.-
Come therefore and take it, and the world’s riches shall be thine.'-
But the young Fisherman laughed.-
'Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,' said the Soul.-
And the Soul answered, 'Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.'-
And the Soul said to him, 'In a city that I know of there is an inn that standeth by a river.-
I sat there with sailors who drank of two different–coloured wines, and ate bread made of barley, and little salt fish served in bay leaves with vinegar.-
And as we sat and made merry, there entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that had two horns of amber.-
And when he had laid out the carpet on the floor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.-
Naked were her feet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons.-
Never have I seen anything so marvellous; and the city in which she dances is but a day’s journey from this place.'-
And a great desire came over him, and he said to himself, 'It is but a day’s journey, and I can return to my love,' and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow water, and strode towards the shore.-
And when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his arms to his Soul.-
And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet him, and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before him upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul.-
So they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon, and all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening of the day they came to a city.-
And his Soul answered him, 'It is not this city, but another.-
So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young Fisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.-
And his Soul answered him, 'It is not this city, but another.-
But his Soul answered him, 'Be at peace, be at peace.'-
And on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, 'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?'-
And his Soul answered him, 'It may be that it is in this city, therefore let us enter in.'-
So he sat him down in the market–place and rested, and after a time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.-
Therefore come with me, for I have a guest–chamber.'-
And when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into the house, the merchant brought him rose–water in a copper dish that he might wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst, and set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him.-
And the young Fisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on his hand, and flung himself down on the carpets of dyed goat’s–hair.-
And the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the merchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved sword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold.-
Come, let us go to another city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.'-
There are the dancing–girls of Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds and beasts.-
Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells.-
They laugh while they dance, and their laughter is as clear as the laughter of water.-
Come with me and I will show them to thee.-
Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?-
There is a little city hard by in which there is a garden of tulip–trees.-
And there dwell in this comely garden white peacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts.-
Their tails when they spread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks.-
And she who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times she dances with her feet.-
Her eyes are coloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a swallow. From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is carved out of a pearl.-
She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver.-
And so trouble not thyself any more, but come with me to this city.'-
It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the Valley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.'-
I will tempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.'-
And the young Fisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the shore. And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them a burden that was whiter than silver.-
White as the surf it was, and like a flower it tossed on the waves.-
He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one trembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast.-
And in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had been troubled.-
And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candle–bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company.-
And when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed himself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange flowers that never had been seen before.-
And he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad.-
And why he so spake, he knew not.-
And he stood as one in a dream.-
The Fauns also he blessed, and the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright–eyed things that peer through the leaves.-
All the things in God’s world he blessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.-
THE STAR–CHILD-
TO MISS MARGOT TENNANT—MRS. ASQUITH-
'The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,' whispered the Turtle–doves to each other.-
Their little pink feet were quite frost–bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation.-
'Well, for my own part,' said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, 'I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.-
The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.-
Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'-
But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.-
So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.-
There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.-
It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow–trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s–throw away.-
'Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,' they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold.-
And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.-
So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.-
And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.-
So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.-
And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.-
His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.-
Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.-
The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.-
God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.-
Even the cattle of the field praise Him.'-
And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.-
And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.-
'Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?-
Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?'-
'Truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'it was even as thou sayest.'-
And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her.-
So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.-
So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star–Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them.-
I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.'-
And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain.-
'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'-
And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.-
One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.-
And he bound the eyes of the Star–Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.-
Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.-
'Come thou with me,' said the Hare, 'and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.'-
So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.-
And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'-
And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of white gold?'-
'Follow me,' cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.-
And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying.-
And the Star–Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.-
And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, 'Hast thou the piece of yellow gold?'-
And the Hare said to him, 'The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.-
Therefore weep no more but be glad.'-
And the Star–Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.-
So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.-
And so large was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a palace of a King.-
And the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers of the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him, and said, 'Thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son of our King.'-
Then he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet crouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, 'How saith my lord that he is not beautiful?'-
And the Star–Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before.-
Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy our King over us.'-
And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down he kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet them with his tears.-
Receive thy child now.'-
And he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a King and a Queen.-
And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him into the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon his head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by the river he ruled, and was its lord.-
Much justice and mercy did he show to all, and the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his wife he sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high honour.-
