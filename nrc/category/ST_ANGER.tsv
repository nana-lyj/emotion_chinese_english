‘Why can't you be like the Happy Prince?’ asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.-
‘How do you know?’ said the Mathematical Master, ‘you have never seen one.’-
‘Ah! but we have, in our dreams,’ answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.-
‘It is a ridiculous attachment,’ twittered the other Swallows; ‘she has no money, and far too many relations’; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.-
‘She has no conversation,’ he said, ‘and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.’-
‘I admit that she is domestic,’ he continued, ‘but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.’-
‘You have been trifling with me,’ he cried.-
The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.’-
‘Why are you weeping then?’ asked the Swallow; ‘you have quite drenched me.’-
He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.-
‘I don't think I like boys,’ answered the Swallow.-
‘Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me.-
They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.’-
‘I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,’ she answered; ‘I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.’-
‘You must not lie here,’ shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.-
‘How shabby indeed!’ cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.-
‘We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.’-
‘Of myself,’ said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.-
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.-
‘For a red rose?’ they cried; ‘how very ridiculous!’ and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.-
In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity.-
She would not sacrifice herself for others.-
She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.-
‘Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,’ said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.-
‘Ungrateful!’ said the girl.-
‘I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?-
Why, I don't believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has’; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.-
‘What I a silly thing Love is,’ said the Student as he walked away.-
‘It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.-
In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.’-
‘What are you doing here?’ he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.-
‘My own garden is my own garden,’ said the Giant; ‘any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.’-
He was a very selfish Giant.-
They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it. -
He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.-
Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. -
‘He is too selfish,’ she said.-
And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, ‘Who hath dared to wound thee?’-
‘Who hath dared to wound thee?’ cried the Giant; ‘tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.’-
‘You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,’ she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done.-
They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.-
‘What disobedient children!’ cried the old Water-rat; ‘they really deserve to be drowned.’ ‘Nothing of the kind,’ answered the Duck, ‘every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.’-
‘Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,’ said the Waterrat; ‘I am not a family man. In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.-
‘And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?’ asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.-
‘What a silly question!’ cried the Water-rat.-
‘I don't understand you,’ answered the Water-rat.-
‘'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller; 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.-
You seem not to learn anything.-
I certainly will not allow Hans' nature to be spoiled.-
Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.-
Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.-
‘Then you are quite behind the age,’ said the Water-rat.-
He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered 'Pooh!'-
‘'Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller; 'friendship never forgets.-
‘'Buy back your wheelbarrow?-
What a very stupid thing to do'!-
I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.-
‘'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.-
I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'-
‘'Well, really,' said the Miller, 'I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.'-
Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder. Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don't like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.-
You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.-
But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?-
‘'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.'-
‘'What do you want, little Hans?'-
‘Well?’ said the Water-rat, after a long pause.-
‘Oh! I really don't know,’ replied the Linnet; ‘and I am sure that I don't care.’-
‘It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,’ said the Water-rat.-
‘I am afraid you don't quite see the moral of the story,’ remarked the Linnet.-
‘The what?’ screamed the Water-rat.-
‘Do you mean to say that the story has a moral?’-
‘Well, really,’ said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, ‘I think you should have told me that before you began.-
If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said 'Pooh,' like the critic.-
However, I can say it now’; so he shouted out ‘Pooh’ at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.-
He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.-
‘The King's garden is not the world, you foolish squib,’ said a big Roman Candle; ‘the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly.’-
They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.-
‘Nonsense!’ said the Roman Candle, ‘Romance never dies.-
It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick.-
‘Order! order!’ cried out a Cracker.-
He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.-
‘Dear me!’ said the little Squib, ‘I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour.’-
‘Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,’ said a Bengal Light; ‘I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.’-
‘Well, I said Pylotechnic,’ answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.-
‘You were talking about yourself,’ replied the Roman Candle.-
‘Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.-
I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.-
‘What is a sensitive person?’ said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.-
‘Pray, what are you laughing at?’ inquired the Rocket; ‘I am not laughing.’-
‘That is a very selfish reason,’ said the Rocket angrily.-
You should be thinking about others.-
I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.-
‘you had better keep yourself dry.’-
‘Common sense, indeed!’ said the Rocket indignantly; ‘you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable.-
Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.-
As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.-
But none of you have any hearts.-
Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.’-
‘Ah! what a trivial view of life!’ said the Rocket; ‘but it is only what I expected.-
‘But they have not lost their only son,’ said the Roman Candle; ‘no misfortune has happened to them at all.’-
‘I never said that they had,’ replied the Rocket; ‘I said that they might.-
I hate people who cry over spilt milk.-
‘You certainly are!’ cried the Bengal Light.-
‘In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.’-
‘You are the rudest person I ever met,’ said the Rocket, ‘and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.’-
‘Why, you don't even know him,’ growled the Roman Candle.-
‘I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.-
‘You had really better keep yourself dry,’ said the Fire-balloon.-
But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, ‘Humbug! humbug!’ at the top of their voices.-
They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.-
‘I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,’ said the Rocket; ‘no doubt that is what it means,’ and he looked more supercilious than ever.-
‘This is evidently a deputation,’ said the Rocket; ‘I will receive them with becoming dignity’ so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.-
‘Hallo!’ he cried, ‘what a bad rocket!’ and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.-
‘BAD Rocket? BAD Rocket?’ he said, as he whirled through the air; ‘impossible! GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.-
BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same’; and he fell into the mud.-
‘Ahem! ahem!’ said the Rocket, and he began to cough.-
In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.-
‘Ahem! ahem!’ said the Rocket angrily.-
He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.-
‘Conversation, indeed!’ said the Rocket.-
‘You have talked the whole time yourself.-
That is not conversation.’-
‘Somebody must listen,’ answered the Frog, ‘and I like to do all the talking myself.-
‘Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions.-
‘You are a very irritating person,’ said the Rocket, ‘and very illbred.-
I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.-
It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.-
Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial.’-
‘Well, that is his loss, not mine,’ answered the Rocket.-
‘I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.-
‘How very silly of him not to stay here!’ said the Rocket.-
‘It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,’ answered the Rocket, ‘otherwise you would know who I am.-
‘I don't think much of that,’ said the Duck, ‘as I cannot see what use it is to any one.-
Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something.’-
‘My good creature,’ cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, ‘I see that you belong to the lower orders.-
I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.-
Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do.’-
Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.-
‘Come back! come back!’ screamed the Rocket, ‘I have a great deal to say to you’; but the Duck paid no attention to him.-
In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!’-
His courtiers had all taken their leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to the ceremonious usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of the Palace, to receive a few last lessons from the Professor of Etiquette; there being some of them who had still quite natural manners, which in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very grave offence. -
Indeed, there is but this difference between us—that he wears fine clothes while I go in rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he suffers not a little from overfeeding. -
'In war,' answered the weaver, 'the strong make slaves of the weak, and in peace the rich make slaves of the poor. -
But what are these things to thee?-
Thou art not one of us. -
' And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle across the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a thread of gold. -
'It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,' he answered; 'what is that to thee?'-
The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the negroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide. -
The negroes seized it from him, and thrust him back. -
The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. -
They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet blossoms. -
'I have three grains of corn,' she answered; 'what is that to thee?'-
'I will not give thee anything,' said Avarice, and she hid her hand in the fold of her raiment. -
'Thou hast slain a third of my servants,' she cried, 'get thee gone. -
What is my valley to thee, that thou should’st tarry in it? Get thee gone, and come here no more. -
But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth. -
 'I will not give thee anything,' she muttered. -
'Thou art cruel,' she cried;-
'thou art cruel. -
Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my servants. -
'Nay,' answered Death, 'but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not go. '-
'I will not give thee anything,' said Avarice. -
But he remembered his dreams, and he said to his lords: 'Take these things away, for I will not wear them. '-
And the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for they thought that he was jesting. -
But he spake sternly to them again, and said: 'Take these things away, and hide them from me. -
Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not wear them. -
And when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and whispered, saying: 'Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream, and a vision but a vision? They are not real things that one should heed them. -
And what have we to do with the lives of those who toil for us? Shall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till he has talked with the vinedresser?'-
And the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him, 'My lord, the people wait for their king, and thou showest them a beggar,' and others were wroth and said, 'He brings shame upon our state, and is unworthy to be our master.' -
And the people laughed and said, 'It is the King’s fool who is riding by,' and they mocked him. -
Wilt thou say to the buyer, ‘Thou shalt buy for so much,’ and to the seller, ‘Thou shalt sell at this price’? I trow not. -
 What hast thou to do with us, and what we suffer?'-
'Ay,' answered the man, 'and the name of the rich brother is Cain. -
And his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, 'I am the King,' and waved their halberts aside and passed in. -
'Sayest thou that in this house?' said the young King, and he strode past the Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the image of Christ. -
'Where is this dreamer of dreams?' they cried. -
'Where is this King who is apparelled like a beggar—this boy who brings shame upon our state? Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.'-
The tall striped tulips stood straight up upon their stalks, like long rows of soldiers, and looked defiantly across the grass at the roses, and said: 'We are quite as splendid as you are now.' -
Behind him stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his confessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side. -
How silly of him, when the sun was shining so brightly, and everybody was so happy! -
The Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could not restrain their feelings any longer. -
'He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we are,' cried the Tulips. -
'He should drink poppy–juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,' said the great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry. -
'And he has actually got one of my best blooms,' exclaimed the White Rose–Tree. -
'I gave it to the Infanta this morning myself, as a birthday present, and he has stolen it from her.' And she called out: 'Thief, thief, thief!' at the top of her voice.-
As for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable individual, and had once told the time of day to no less a person than the Emperor Charles V. himself, he was so taken aback by the little Dwarf’s appearance, that he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long shadowy finger, and could not help saying to the great milk–white Peacock, who was sunning herself on the balustrade, that every one knew that the children of Kings were Kings, and that the children of charcoal–burners were charcoal–burners, and that it was absurd to pretend that it wasn’t so; a statement with which the Peacock entirely agreed, and indeed screamed out, 'Certainly, certainly,' in such a loud, harsh voice, that the gold–fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing fountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone Tritons what on earth was the matter.-
The Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at the behaviour of the birds. -
They are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.'-
'He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life,' they said.-
'Look at his hunched back, and his crooked legs,' and they began to titter.-
He struck at it, and it returned blow for blow.-
He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him.-
Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the voice?-
Why had they not left him in the forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was?-
'Yes,' cried all the children, 'you must get up and dance, for you are as clever as the Barbary apes, and much more ridiculous.' But the little Dwarf made no answer.-
And the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was walking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that had just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been established.-
'My funny little dwarf is sulking,' she cried, 'you must wake him up, and tell him to dance for me.'-
And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose–leaf lips curled in pretty disdain.-
'For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,' she cried, and she ran out into the garden.-
'The love of the body is vile,' cried the Priest, knitting his brows, 'and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world. Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea! I have heard them at night–time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads. They tap at the window, and laugh. They whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.-
They tempt me with temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me. They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost. For them there is no heaven nor hell, and in neither shall they praise God’s name.'-
'Father,' cried the young Fisherman, 'thou knowest not what thou sayest. Once in my net I snared the daughter of a King. She is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon. For her body I would give my soul, and for her love I would surrender heaven. Tell me what I ask of thee, and let me go in peace.'-
And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.-
But the merchants mocked at him, and said, 'Of what use is a man’s soul to us?-
It is not worth a clipped piece of silver. Sell us thy body for a slave, and we will clothe thee in sea–purple, and put a ring upon thy finger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen. But talk not of the soul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.'-
'My desire is but for a little thing,' said the young Fisherman, 'yet hath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth. It is but for a little thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me. Therefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be thy price I shall pay it.'-
'Pretty boy, pretty boy,' she muttered, 'that is a terrible thing to do.'-
She laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock. 'I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,' she answered, 'and I can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if I will it. He whom I serve is richer than all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.'-
'What then shall I give thee,' he cried, 'if thy price be neither gold nor silver?'-
And after a time she clenched her hands in anger.-
'He should have been mine,' she muttered, 'I am as fair as she is.'-
But there was disdain in it. He kept looking at the young Fisherman.-
And the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman caught her by her wrists, and held her fast.-
'Loose me,' she cried, 'and let me go.-
'Nay,' he answered, 'but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret.'-
'What secret?' said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and biting her foam–flecked lips.-
But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, 'If thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.'-
'Thou hast done me no evil, but I have no need of thee,' he answered.-
'My heart is my love’s,' he answered, 'therefore tarry not, but get thee gone.'-
'Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,' cried the young Fisherman, and he took the little knife with its handle of green viper’s skin, and cut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before him, and looked at him, and it was even as himself.-
'Get thee gone,' he murmured, 'and let me see thy face no more.'-
And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, 'Why dost thou call to me?'-
'As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his sword, and asked me my business.-
'The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to enter their gates.-
The rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil fortune.-
'And I said to the priest, ‘Is this the god?’-
'And I said to the priest, ‘Where is the god?’-
And after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, 'Why dost thou call to me?'-
'When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was.-
I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled.-
'Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.-
I stood quite still, and made him no obeisance.-
I paid no heed to them, but went and sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of their craft are abominated.-
'When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, ‘What is thy name?-
Knowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?’ But I made him no answer.-
I pray thee leave my city to–night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its lord.’-
And the thing shall be done to–night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should see that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.’-
Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city.’-
And after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman frowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, 'Why didst thou tell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?'-
And after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman grew wroth, and said to his Soul, 'Why didst thou tell me to smite the child, for it was an evil thing to do?'-
And he reached out his hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it the merchant started and awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword and cried to the young Fisherman, 'Dost thou return evil for good, and pay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?'-
'Nay,' cried the young Fisherman, 'I may not be at peace, for all that thou hast made me to do I hate.-
Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me wherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.'-
Hast thou forgotten that thou gavest me no heart?-
And when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to his Soul, 'Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and hast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of sin.'-
But the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them down, and trampled on them.-
'Nay,' he cried, 'but I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I journey with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will I send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no good.'-
And the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, 'She was a false Witch in that she told me not that.'-
So he spake to the young Fisherman and said, 'I have told thee of the joy of the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me.-
To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each other.-
And what is love, that thou shouldst set this high store upon it?'-
The moon heard thy name, yet hadst thou no heed of me.-
Accursed be the Sea–folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them.-
For accursed were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.'-
And when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the Priest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds of the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God.-
And after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, 'What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?'-
'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.-
Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'-
'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.-
'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.-
On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron–shod boots upon the caked snow.-
And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.-
But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?-
Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.-
The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.-
Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.-
Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'-
But the Star–Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.-
And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was.-
But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.-
Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill– favoured.'-
And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'-
And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?-
I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'-
'And what signs didst thou find with him?' she cried.-
'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. -
Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'-
And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.-
'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.-
Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.'-
'Nay,' said the Star–Child, 'but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.'-
Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,' and they drave him out of the garden.-
And the Star–Child frowned and said to himself, 'What is this that they say to me?-
And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.-
How should I know?'-
And the Linnet answered, 'Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.-
And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.-
But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'-
But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, 'Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill–favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.-
Get thee gone.-
Get thee gone.-
But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.-
