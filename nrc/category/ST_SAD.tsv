‘I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,’ muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.-
One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.-
Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.-
After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his ladylove.-
‘Will you come away with me?’ he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.-
‘I have a golden bedroom,’ he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.-
‘What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?’ he said; ‘I must look for a good chimney-pot,’ and he determined to fly away.-
The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.-
His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.-
‘When I was alive and had a human heart,’ answered the statue, ‘I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of SansSouci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.-
So I lived, and so I died.-
And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.’-
‘Far away,’ continued the statue in a low musical voice, ‘far away in a little street there is a poor house.-
One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.-
Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.-
In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.-
He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.-
His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.-
My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.’-
‘I am waited for in Egypt,’ said the Swallow.-
Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.-
The King is there himself in his painted coffin.-
Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.’-
The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.’-
But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.-
He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.-
At last he came to the poor house and looked in.-
The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble.-
He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.-
He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more.-
There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.’-
‘Alas! I have no ruby now,’ said the Prince; ‘my eyes are all that I have left.-
‘Dear Prince,’ said the Swallow, ‘I cannot do that’; and he began to weep.-
So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret.-
It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.-
‘I am going to Egypt’! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.-
‘I am come to bid you good-bye,’ he cried.-
She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.-
Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying.-
She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare.-
‘No, little Swallow,’ said the poor Prince, ‘you must go away to Egypt.’-
‘Dear little Swallow,’ said the Prince, ‘you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.-
There is no Mystery so great as Misery.-
So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.-
He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.-
Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm.-
‘How hungry we are!’ they said.-
‘I am covered with fine gold,’ said the Prince, ‘you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.’-
Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.-
He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.-
But at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more.-
‘It is not to Egypt that I am going,’ said the Swallow.-
And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.-
The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two.-
As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: ‘Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!’ he said.-
‘The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,’ said the Mayor in fact, ‘he is litttle beter than a beggar!’-
‘Little better than a beggar,’ said the Town Councillors.-
‘And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!’ continued the Mayor.-
So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.-
‘As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,’ said the Art Professor at the University.-
‘This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.-
We must throw it away.’-
So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.-
‘Bring me the two most precious things in the city,’ said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.-
THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE-
‘She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,’ cried the young Student; ‘but in all my garden there is no red rose.’-
‘No red rose in all my garden!’ he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.-
‘Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.’-
His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.’-
But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.-
She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.’-
‘What I sing of, he suffers--what is joy to me, to him is pain.-
Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.-
It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.’-
But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her’; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.-
‘Why is he weeping?’ asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.-
‘He is weeping for a red rose,’ said the Nightingale.-
But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.-
She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.-
But the Tree shook its head.-
But the Tree shook its head.-
But the Tree shook its head.-
But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.’-
‘One red rose is all I want,’ cried the Nightingale, ‘only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?’-
‘If you want a red rose,’ said the Tree, ‘you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.-
‘Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,’ cried the Nightingale, ‘and Life is very dear to all.-
She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.-
The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.-
I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood.-
The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.-
But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.-
‘Sing me one last song,’ he whispered; ‘I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.’-
‘She has form,’ he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove--’that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?-
What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.’-
And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.-
All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.-
All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.-
But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.-
And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.-
Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.-
But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.-
Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.-
‘Look, look!’ cried the Tree, ‘the rose is finished now’; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.-
But the girl frowned.-
Only a Student.-
So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.-
After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle. -
The poor children had now nowhere to play.-
‘How happy we were there,’ they said to each other.-
Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. -
The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.-
Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.-
‘Spring has forgotten this garden,’ they cried, ‘so we will live here all the year round.’-
He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.-
‘I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,’ said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; ‘I hope there will be a change in the weather.’-
But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. -
The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none.-
So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.-
It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.-
It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.-
He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.-
The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.-
‘Climb up! little boy,’ said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.-
‘How selfish I have been!’ he said; ‘now I know why the Spring would not come here.-
He was really very sorry for what he had done.-
Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.-
‘But where is your little companion?’ he said: ‘the boy I put into the tree.’-
‘We don't know,’ answered the children; ‘he has gone away.’-
But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.-
But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.-
The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.-
Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. -
And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.-
But the little ducks paid no attention to her.-
During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.-
In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.-
‘'There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,' the Miller used to say to his wife, 'for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.-
looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea.-
‘Is that the end of the story?’ asked the Water-rat.-
‘Certainly not,’ answered the Linnet, ‘that is the beginning.’-
‘So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.-
'and wondered how you were getting on.'-
You don't mean to say you have sold it?-
You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.-
So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.-
‘'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.-
‘'Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, 'but I am really very busy to-day.-
‘It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest.-
‘Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.-
‘'I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, 'but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.-
‘Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.-
But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.'-
It took him the whole day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.-
‘But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.-
‘'Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, 'I am in great trouble.-
But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.-
‘'I am very sorry,' answered the Miller, 'but it is my new lantern, and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.'-
His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.-
‘Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.-
‘'As I was his best friend,' said the Miller, 'it is only fair that I should have the best place'; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.-
‘'A great loss to me at any rate,' answered the Miller; 'why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don't know what to do with it.-
It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it.-
One always suffers for being generous.'‘-
‘Well, that is the end,’ said the Linnet.-
‘But what became of the Miller?’ asked the Water-rat.-
‘He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.’-
Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.-
‘Any place you love is the world to you,’ exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; ‘but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.-
True love suffers, and is silent.-
I remember myself once--But it is no matter now. Romance is a thing of the past.’-
But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.-
‘Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,’ she murmured.-
‘Ahem! ahem!’ he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, ‘Romance is dead.’-
‘Quite dead,’ whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.-
‘It may be so with you,’ he answered; ‘indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.-
‘What right have you to be happy?-
In fact, you should be thinking about me.-
Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!-
The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.-
Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.’-
Fortunately for myself, I don't care.-
There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.-
Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.-
What a terrible misfortune! Poor people, to lose their only son! It is really too dreadful! I shall never get over it.’-
If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.-
But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.’-
‘I never said I knew him,’ answered the Rocket.-
‘Very important for you, I have no doubt,’ answered the Rocket, ‘but I shall weep if I choose’; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.-
‘He must have a truly romantic nature,’ said the Catherine Wheel, ‘for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about’; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.-
Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket.-
He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.-
The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.-
But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.-
‘It is not comfortable here,’ he remarked, ‘but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.-
I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.-
What a pity!’-
I am off to look for my daughters.-
‘There is no good talking to him,’ said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; ‘no good at all, for he has gone away.’-
Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day’; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.-
It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.-
A person of my position is never useful.-
The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.-
There is neither society here, nor solitude.-
In fact, it is essentially suburban.-
However, they did not seem to have much effect.-
As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things.’-
‘I am glad that she has gone,’ he said to himself, ‘she has a decidedly middle-class mind’; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.-
The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.-
‘Now I am going off!’ he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.-
But nobody saw him.-
But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.-
It was the night before the day fixed for his coronation, and the young King was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber. -
The child of the old King’s only daughter by a secret marriage with one much beneath her in station—a stranger, some said, who, by the wonderful magic of his lute–playing, had made the young Princess love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom the Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour, and who had suddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the Cathedral unfinished—he had been, when but a week old, stolen away from his mother’s side, as she slept, and given into the charge of a common peasant and his wife, who were without children of their own, and lived in a remote part of the forest, more than a day’s ride from the town. -
Grief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some suggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine, slew, within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him birth, and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his saddle–bow stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of the goatherd’s hut, the body of the Princess was being lowered into an open grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city gates, a grave where it was said that another body was also lying, that of a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied behind him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many red wounds. -
Certain it was that the old King, when on his deathbed, whether moved by remorse for his great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass away from his line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the Council, had acknowledged him as his heir. -
He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace—Joyeuse, as they called it—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh–fashioned for his delight; and as soon as he could escape from the council– board or audience–chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from sickness. -
On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and after a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one of the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a Greek gem carved with the figure of Adonis. -
Indeed, it was of this that he was thinking to–night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching the great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth. -
After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly–lit room. -
Pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling. -
Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river. -
His heavy eyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him. -
The meagre daylight peered in through the grated windows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over their cases. -
Pale, sickly–looking children were crouched on the huge crossbeams. -
Their faces were pinched with famine, and their thin hands shook and trembled. -
Some haggard women were seated at a table sewing. -
The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp. -
 'Our master!' cried the weaver, bitterly. -
We must work to live, and they give us such mean wages that we die. -
We toil for them all day long, and they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil. -
We tread out the grapes, and another drinks the wine. -
We sow the corn, and our own board is empty. -
We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and are slaves, though men call us free. -
'Is it so with all?' he asked, 'It is so with all,' answered the weaver, 'with the young as well as with the old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children as well as with those who are stricken in years. -
The merchants grind us down, and we must needs do their bidding. -
The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no man has care of us. -
Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night. -
The slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin–cloth, and each man was chained to his neighbour. -
They stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the water. -
A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust. -
He fell heavily into the surf, and his companions galloped away. -
A woman wrapped in a yellow veil followed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then at the dead body. -
He crept wearily down the ladder, and disappeared into the sea. -
A few bubbles rose where he sank. -
At the prow of the galley sat a shark–charmer, beating monotonously upon a drum. -
The slaves fell asleep over their oars. -
He quivered for a little, and then he was still. -
The negroes shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard. -
And when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and through the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at the fading stars. -
Huge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud. -
On and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there he saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried–up river. -
From the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death said, 'I am weary; give me a third of them and let me go. -
' But Avarice shook her head. -
She passed through the great multitude, and a third of them lay dead. -
And when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her breast and wept. -
She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud. -
The grass withered beneath her feet as she walked. -
There is famine in the walled cities of India, and the cisterns of Samarcand have run dry. -
She covered the valley with her wings, and no man was left alive. -
And the young King wept, and said: 'Who were these men, and for what were they seeking?'-
For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain, has this my robe been woven. -
' And he told them his three dreams. -
And the young King looked at him. -
 'Will they not know me for a king if I have not a king’s raiment?'-
'I had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,' he answered, 'but it may be as thou sayest. -
And yet I will not wear this robe, nor will I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so will I go forth from it. -
And he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as his companion, a lad a year younger than himself. -
Him he kept for his service, and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he opened a great painted chest, and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin cloak that he had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy goats of the goatherd. -
These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude shepherd’s staff. -
But he answered them not a word, but passed on, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the gates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the cathedral, the little page running beside him. -
' And he told them his three dreams. -
To toil for a hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is more bitter still. -
And the young King’s eyes filled with tears, and he rode on through the murmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid and left him. -
'Shall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?' said the young King. -
And when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, 'My son, I am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil things are done in the wide world. -
The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the dogs. -
 And as for thy dreams, think no more of them. -
 The burden of this world is too great for one man to bear, and the world’s sorrow too heavy for-
one heart to suffer. -
He bowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept away from the altar. -
And the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had finished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them sadly. -
From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them. -
Sadder even than usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with childish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan at the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought of the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before—so it seemed to him—had come from the gay country of France, and had withered away in the sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after the birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice in the orchard, or plucked the second year’s fruit from the old gnarled fig–tree that stood in the centre of the now grass–grown courtyard. -
She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who in return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy and suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said, to the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her in on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.-
Once every month the King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand, went in and knelt by her side calling out, 'Mi reina! Mi reina!' and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs every separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a King, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face.-
Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his country, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the New World. -
When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of reason. Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally abdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of which he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the little Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain, was notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen’s death by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her on the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon. -
Even after the expiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained throughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his ministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself sent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of Bohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their master that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that though she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an answer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which soon after, at the Emperor’s instigation, revolted against him under the leadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church.-
His whole married life, with its fierce, fiery–coloured joys and the terrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him to–day as he watched the Infanta playing on the terrace.-
But the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears, and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a dull odour of strange spices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint—or was it fancy?—the clear morning air. -
He buried his face in his hands, and when the Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King had retired.-
She made a little moue of disappointment, and shrugged her shoulders. Surely he might have stayed with her on her birthday.-
What did the stupid State–affairs matter? Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where the candles were always burning, and where she was never allowed to enter? -
nothing of the puppet–show and the other wonderful things. -
They acted so well, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of the play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears. Indeed some of the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats, and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires, should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.-
So they played on very gently and just touching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and their heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep. -
Then at another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay there quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound that broke the silence. -
useless a child. -
Lizards were extremely philosophical by nature, and often sat thinking for hours and hours together, when there was nothing else to do, or when the weather was too rainy for them to go out.-
When we do want change of air, we send for the gardener, and he carries us to another bed.-
But the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.-
How he wished that he had gone back with her!-
He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.-
The whole palace seemed asleep, and even where the shutters had not been closed, heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the glare.-
But the little Infanta was not there, only some wonderful white statues that looked down on him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and strangely smiling lips.-
He ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door. No! She was not here either. The room was quite empty.-
But the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.-
Nor was he alone.-
The little Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also.-
He brushed his hair off his eyes.-
He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the room.-
Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch for couch.-
When the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell sobbing to the ground.-
So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked, foul to look at and grotesque.-
He himself was the monster, and it was at him that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who he had thought loved him—she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness, and making merry over his twisted limbs.-
Why had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame?-
The hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to pieces.-
The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint petals in the air.-
It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a face drawn with pain.-
He crawled, like some wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.-
But the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and fainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.-
And then he fell back again, and lay quite still.-
But the little Dwarf never moved.-
'A whipping master should be sent for,' said Don Pedro wearily, and he went back to the terrace.-
But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt beside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart.-
And after a few moments he shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low bow to the Infanta, he said – 'Mi bella Princesa, your funny little dwarf will never dance again.-
It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.'-
'Because his heart is broken,' answered the Chamberlain.-
THE FISHERMAN AND HIS SOUL-
Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his nets into the water.-
But no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but only a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.-
Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass. Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl. Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea–shells were her ears, and her lips were like sea–coral. The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.-
And when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to weep, and said, 'I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a King, and my father is aged and alone.' But the young Fisherman answered, 'I will not let thee go save thou makest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to me, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea–folk, and so shall my nets be full.'-
'Alas! I know not,' said the little Mermaid: 'the Sea–folk have no souls.' And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.-
And the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet–smelling rushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the Holy Book and said to him, 'Father, I am in love with one of the Sea–folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire. Tell me how I can send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it. Of what value is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.'-
The young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, 'Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold. Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers. And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing that I love?'-
And the young Fisherman went down into the market–place, and he walked slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.-
'I will sell thee my soul,' he answered. 'I pray thee buy it of me, for I am weary of it. Of what use is my soul to me? I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.'-
And the young Fisherman said to himself: 'How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.' And he passed out of the market–place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.-
'I would send my soul away from me,' answered the young Fisherman.-
answered. 'I cannot see it. I may not touch it. I do not know it.'-
'Five pieces of gold,' he said, 'and my nets, and the wattled house where I live, and the painted boat in which I sail. -
She shook her head. -
There was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below.-
'It matters not,' she answered. -
And the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her sight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of carved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted charcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.-
And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.-
He struck it with a rod of willow, and it went away whining.-
He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of his dagger.-
Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes.-
No sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain.-
As he leapt upon the saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly.-
Her grass–green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman, 'Ask me anything but that!'-
And when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him,-
'It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,' she cried, and she clung to his knees weeping.-
He put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge of the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down.-
And his Soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from crag to crag, being sure–footed as a wild goat, and at last he reached the level ground and the yellow shore of the sea.-
And his Soul said to him, 'If indeed thou must drive me from thee, send me not forth without a heart.-
Its voice was low and flute–like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake.-
'How shall we meet?' cried the young Fisherman.-
And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.-
And when they had sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes.-
The land was dry and burnt up with the heat.-
'At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of those that came back not a few had been wounded.-
Then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction.-
A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.-
It was night–time when we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was sultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.-
'And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.-
'And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god.-
I lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad leaves.-
‘The god is asleep,’ he murmured.-
On its forehead was a ruby, and thick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs.-
And I touched his hand, and it became withered.-
And I touched his eyes, and they became blind.-
And it reflecteth all things that are in heaven and on earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it.-
This it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.-
Many other mirrors are there, but they are mirrors of Opinion.-
And they who possess it not have not Wisdom.-
And I looked into the mirror, and it was even as he had said to me.-
'And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley that is but a day’s journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of Wisdom.-
'Love is better,' answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.-
Surely thou shouldst have been with me.-
When they are glad they go to the bird–sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less.-
But I did not care.-
There were no windows to it, only a little door like the door of a tomb.-
'When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the house, but it was no longer there.-
When I saw that, I knew who the woman was, and wherefore she had smiled at me.-
I stood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.-
When I told them what I had done, each of them gave me a god and prayed me to leave them.-
The cypress–trees were like burnt–out torches.-
I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into two pieces.-
'And the Emperor frowned.-
‘It is but a ring of lead,’ he cried, ‘nor has it any value.-
'Love is better,' answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes.-
So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened.-
Her face was veiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked.-
Now when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he remembered that the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance.-
And the young Fisherman said to his Soul, 'Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?'-
So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals, the young Fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water.-
And his Soul said to him, 'Smite that child.' So he smote the child till it wept, and when he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city.-
So they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the young Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side.-
And the young Fisherman answered him, 'I can find no inn in this city, nor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.'-
And when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat his breast, and said to his Soul, 'Why didst thou bid me slay the merchant and take his gold? Surely thou art evil.'-
And his Soul answered him, 'When thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love them.'-
I trow not.-
And his Soul answered him, 'Thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart.-
And he turned his back to the moon, and with the little knife that had the handle of green viper’s skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body which is the body of the Soul.-
Once in his life may a man send his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it with him for ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.'-
And when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his Soul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he fell upon the ground weeping bitterly.-
Even to the sea will I return, and to the little bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her the evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.'-
The world has many fairer than she is.-
But she came not to his call, though he called to her all day long and besought her.-
And his Soul mocked him and said, 'Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love.-
Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken vessel.-
Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in return.-
But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock he built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a year.-
Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in the pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the deep.-
Suffer me now to tell thee of the world’s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken.-
There be some who lack raiment, and others who lack bread.-
There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in rags.-
The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are empty.-
Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and make them not to be.-
Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy love, seeing she comes not to thy call?-
Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the valleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple, and in the sea that the dawn leaves grey.-
'Alas!' cried his Soul, 'I can find no place of entrance, so compassed about with love is this heart of thine.'-
'Yet I would that I could help thee,' said the young Fisherman.-
And as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the cry that men hear when one of the Sea–folk is dead.-
And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.-
Dead at his feet it was lying.-
Weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he kissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the hair.-
Salt was the honey of the hair, yet he tasted it with a bitter joy.-
his tears.-
And to the dead thing he made confession.-
Into the shells of its ears he poured the harsh wine of his tale.-
He put the little hands round his neck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat. Bitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain.-
From the palace of the Sea–King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns.-
I called on thee at dawn, and thou didst not come to my call.-
For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away.-
And now that thou art dead, surely I will die with thee also.'-
And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves, and when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake.-
And the sea covered the young Fisherman with its waves.-
And when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying drowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little Mermaid.-
And as for him who for love’s sake forsook God, and so lieth here with his leman slain by God’s judgment, take up his body and the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none may know the place of their resting.-
And the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid the dead things within it.-
Strange were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils.-
And when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went back to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.-
And the deacons came in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the girdle, the maniple and the stole.-
And they answered him, 'What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they come from the corner of the Fullers' Field.'-
Yet never again in the corner of the Fullers' Field grew flowers of any kind, but the field remained barren even as before.-
Nor came the Sea–folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.-
Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine–forest.-
The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain–Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice–King had kissed her.-
'Weet! weet! weet!' twittered the green Linnets, 'the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.'-
'Truly,' answered his companion, 'much is given to some, and little is given to others.-
Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.'-
But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.-
And one of them said to the other: 'This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?-
Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.'-
'Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.'-
Who is there who careth for us?-
And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold.-
'Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?' he asked.-
And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire.-
And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.-
And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also.-
Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar–woman.-
Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.-
And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut–tree to rest.-
And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.-
And the Woodcutter answered, 'Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.'-
For I see none here but this vile beggar–woman.'-
'I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.-
'The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,' she murmured, 'but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.-
But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.-
For I have suffered much to find thee.'-
So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.-
For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.-
And he said to her, 'Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.-
Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.'-
So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.-
All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past.-
And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.-
And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother.-
He said to the Mole, 'Thou canst go beneath the earth. Tell me, is my mother there?'-
Tell me, canst thou see my mother?'-
And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'-
And the Star–Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar–woman.-
Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar–woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.-
But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow.-
For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.-
And one evening he came to the gate of a strong–walled city that stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.-
Thy mother dwells not in this city.'-
And he answered, 'My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.'-
And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.-
And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'-
And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.-
And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.-
And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street.-
Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. -
Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.-
And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.-
But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.-
And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.-
Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.-
For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.'-
And the Star–Child answered, 'I have it not.'-
So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.-
And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have it not.'-
So the Star–Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.-
And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.-
Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.-
But lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down and made obeisance to him, saying, 'How beautiful is our lord!' and a crowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, 'Surely there is none so beautiful in the whole world!' so that the Star–Child wept, and said to himself, 'They are mocking me, and making light of my misery.'-
And the Star–Child answered them and said, 'I am no king’s son, but the child of a poor beggar–woman.-
And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I know that I am evil to look at?'-
But he said to them, 'I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who bare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.-
Therefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not tarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.'-
Amongst the crowd that pressed round the soldiers, he saw the beggar–woman who was his mother, and at her side stood the leper, who had sat by the road.-
He bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might break, he said to her: 'Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.-
Accept me in the hour of my humility.-
Mother, I gave thee hatred.-
Mother, I rejected thee.-
But the beggar–woman answered him not a word.-
Bid my mother speak to me once.'-
But the leper answered him not a word.-
And he sobbed again and said: 'Mother, my suffering is greater than I can bear.-
Yet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the fire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died.-
